        "actress, and, the match meeting with parental disapproval, had himself\r\n",
        "taken to the stage as a profession. Notwithstanding Mrs. Poe's beauty\r\n",
        "and talent the young couple had a sorry struggle for existence. When\r\n",
        "Edgar, at the age of two years, was orphaned, the family was in the\r\n",
        "utmost destitution. Apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the\r\n",
        "world homeless and friendless. But fate decreed that a few glimmers of\r\n",
        "sunshine were to illumine his life, for the little fellow was adopted\r\n",
        "by John Allan, a wealthy merchant of Richmond, Va. A brother and sister,\r\n",
        "the remaining children, were cared for by others.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In his new home Edgar found all the luxury and advantages money could\r\n",
        "provide. He was petted, spoiled and shown off to strangers. In Mrs.\r\n",
        "Allan he found all the affection a childless wife could bestow. Mr.\r\n",
        "Allan took much pride in the captivating, precocious lad. At the age of\r\n",
        "five the boy recited, with fine effect, passages of English poetry to\r\n",
        "the visitors at the Allan house.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "From his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the Manor House\r\n",

        "Wilson.\" Returning to Richmond in 1820 Edgar was sent to the school\r\n",
        "of Professor Joseph H. Clarke. He proved an apt pupil. Years afterward\r\n",
        "Professor Clarke thus wrote:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"While the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses, Poe wrote genuine\r\n",
        "poetry; the boy was a born poet. As a scholar he was ambitious to\r\n",
        "excel. He was remarkable for self-respect, without haughtiness. He had\r\n",
        "a sensitive and tender heart and would do anything for a friend. His\r\n",
        "nature was entirely free from selfishness.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "At the age of seventeen Poe entered the University of Virginia at\r\n",
        "Charlottesville. He left that institution after one session. Official\r\n",
        "records prove that he was not expelled. On the contrary, he gained\r\n",
        "a creditable record as a student, although it is admitted that he\r\n",
        "contracted debts and had \"an ungovernable passion for card-playing.\"\r\n",
        "These debts may have led to his quarrel with Mr. Allan which eventually\r\n",
        "compelled him to make his own way in the world.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Early in 1827 Poe made his first literary venture. He induced Calvin\r\n",
        "Thomas, a poor and youthful printer, to publish a small volume of his\r\n",
        "verses under the title \"Tamerlane and Other Poems.\" In 1829 we find Poe\r\n",
        "in Baltimore with another manuscript volume of verses, which was soon\r\n",
        "published. Its title was \"Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Other Poems.\" Neither\r\n",
        "of these ventures seems to have attracted much attention.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Soon after Mrs. Allan's death, which occurred in 1829, Poe, through\r\n",
        "the aid of Mr. Allan, secured admission to the United States Military\r\n",
        "Academy at West Point. Any glamour which may have attached to cadet life\r\n",
        "in Poe's eyes was speedily lost, for discipline at West Point was never\r\n",
        "so severe nor were the accommodations ever so poor. Poe's bent was\r\n",
        "more and more toward literature. Life at the academy daily became\r\n",
        "increasingly distasteful. Soon he began to purposely neglect his studies\r\n",
        "and to disregard his duties, his aim being to secure his dismissal from\r\n",
        "the United States service. In this he succeeded. On March 7, 1831, Poe\r\n",
        "found himself free. Mr. Allan's second marriage had thrown the lad on\r\n",
        "his own resources. His literary career was to begin.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Poe's first genuine victory was won in 1833, when he was the successful\r\n",
        "competitor for a prize of $100 offered by a Baltimore periodical for the\r\n",
        "best prose story. \"A MSS. Found in a Bottle\" was the winning tale. Poe\r\n",
        "had submitted six stories in a volume. \"Our only difficulty,\" says Mr.\r\n",
        "Latrobe, one of the judges, \"was in selecting from the rich contents of\r\n",
        "the volume.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "During the fifteen years of his literary life Poe was connected with\r\n",
        "various newspapers and magazines in Richmond, Philadelphia and New York.\r\n",
        "He was faithful, punctual, industrious, thorough. N. P. Willis, who for\r\n",
        "some time employed Poe as critic and sub-editor on the \"Evening Mirror,\"\r\n",
        "wrote thus:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"With the highest admiration for Poe's genius, and a willingness to\r\n",
        "let it alone for more than ordinary irregularity, we were led by\r\n",
        "common report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties, and\r\n",
        "occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time went on,\r\n",
        "however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious. We saw but\r\n",
        "one presentiment of the man-a quiet, patient, industrious and most\r\n",
        "gentlemanly person.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be stated in all\r\n",
        "mention of his lamentable irregularities), that with a single glass of\r\n",
        "wine his whole nature was reversed, the demon became uppermost, and,\r\n",
        "though none of the usual signs of intoxication were visible, his will\r\n",
        "was palpably insane. In this reversed character, we repeat, it was never\r\n",
        "our chance to meet him.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "On September 22, 1835, Poe married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in\r\n",

        "twenty-six. He then was a resident of Richmond and a regular contributor\r\n",

        "the bride and her widowed mother followed him thither.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Poe's devotion to his child-wife was one of the most beautiful features\r\n",
        "of his life. Many of his famous poetic productions were inspired by her\r\n",
        "beauty and charm. Consumption had marked her for its victim, and the\r\n",
        "constant efforts of husband and mother were to secure for her all the\r\n",
        "comfort and happiness their slender means permitted. Virginia died\r\n",
        "January 30, 1847, when but twenty-five years of age. A friend of the\r\n",

        "warmth to her by chafing her hands and her feet, while her pet cat was\r\n",
        "suffered to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "These verses from \"Annabel Lee,\" written by Poe in 1849, the last year\r\n",

        "talent writhe and contort itself as it may, it has no such magnetism.\r\n",
        "Larger of bone and sinew it may be, but the wings are wanting. Talent\r\n",

        "clay. Genius claims kindred with the very workings of Nature herself, so\r\n",

        "all is to say that he needs only zeal, industry, and a reverence for the\r\n",
        "trust reposed in him, to achieve the proudest triumphs and the greenest\r\n",
        "laurels. If we may believe the Longinuses; and Aristotles of our\r\n",

        "render a place among them at all desirable, whether for its hardness\r\n",
        "of attainment or its seclusion. The highest peak of our Parnassus is,\r\n",

        "Mr. Poe has two of the prime qualities of genius, a faculty of vigorous\r\n",
        "yet minute analysis, and a wonderful fecundity of imagination. The first\r\n",
        "of these faculties is as needful to the artist in words, as a knowledge\r\n",
        "of anatomy is to the artist in colors or in stone. This enables him to\r\n",
        "conceive truly, to maintain a proper relation of parts, and to draw a\r\n",
        "correct outline, while the second groups, fills up and colors. Both\r\n",
        "of these Mr. Poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his prose\r\n",
        "works, the last predominating in his earlier tales, and the first in his\r\n",
        "later ones. In judging of the merit of an author, and assigning him his\r\n",
        "niche among our household gods, we have a right to regard him from\r\n",
        "our own point of view, and to measure him by our own standard. But,\r\n",
        "in estimating the amount of power displayed in his works, we must be\r\n",
        "governed by his own design, and placing them by the side of his own\r\n",
        "ideal, find how much is wanting. We differ from Mr. Poe in his opinions\r\n",
        "of the objects of art. He esteems that object to be the creation of\r\n",
        "Beauty, and perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we\r\n",
        "disagree with him. But in what we shall say of his writings, we shall\r\n",
        "take his own standard as our guide. The temple of the god of song is\r\n",
        "equally accessible from every side, and there is room enough in it for\r\n",
        "all who bring offerings, or seek in oracle.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In his tales, Mr. Poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in that\r\n",
        "dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of the probable\r\n",
        "into the weird confines of superstition and unreality. He combines in\r\n",
        "a very remarkable manner two faculties which are seldom found united; a\r\n",
        "power of influencing the mind of the reader by the impalpable shadows\r\n",
        "of mystery, and a minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or\r\n",
        "a button unnoticed. Both are, in truth, the natural results of the\r\n",
        "predominating quality of his mind, to which we have before alluded,\r\n",
        "analysis. It is this which distinguishes the artist. His mind at once\r\n",
        "reaches forward to the effect to be produced. Having resolved to bring\r\n",
        "about certain emotions in the reader, he makes all subordinate parts\r\n",
        "tend strictly to the common centre. Even his mystery is mathematical\r\n",
        "to his own mind. To him X is a known quantity all along. In any picture\r\n",
        "that he paints he understands the chemical properties of all his\r\n",
        "colors. However vague some of his figures may seem, however formless\r\n",
        "the shadows, to him the outline is as clear and distinct as that of\r\n",
        "a geometrical diagram. For this reason Mr. Poe has no sympathy with\r\n",
        "Mysticism. The Mystic dwells in the mystery, is enveloped with it; it\r\n",
        "colors all his thoughts; it affects his optic nerve especially, and the\r\n",
        "commonest things get a rainbow edging from it. Mr. Poe, on the other\r\n",
        "hand, is a spectator _ab extra_. He analyzes, he dissects, he watches\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "        \"with an eye serene,\r\n",

        "all working to produce a certain end.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "This analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical, and by giving\r\n",
        "him the patience to be minute, enables him to throw a wonderful reality\r\n",
        "into his most unreal fancies. A monomania he paints with great power. He\r\n",
        "loves to dissect one of these cancers of the mind, and to trace all the\r\n",
        "subtle ramifications of its roots. In raising images of horror, also,\r\n",
        "he has strange success, conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint\r\n",
        "some terrible _doubt _which is the secret of all horror. He leaves to\r\n",
        "imagination the task of finishing the picture, a task to which only she\r\n",

        "demonstrations. Yet they stand in strikingly refreshing contrast with\r\n",
        "the vague generalisms and sharp personalities of the day. If deficient\r\n",

        "BY late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high state\r\n",
        "of philosophical excitement. Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of\r\n",
        "a nature so completely unexpected--so entirely novel--so utterly at\r\n",

        "mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in the\r\n",
        "well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was warm--unusually so for\r\n",

        "were in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with friendly\r\n",

        "of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the\r\n",
        "firmament. Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation\r\n",
        "became apparent in the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues\r\n",
        "succeeded; and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were\r\n",
        "upturned toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously\r\n",
        "from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be\r\n",

        "so whimsically put together, as not to be in any manner comprehended,\r\n",
        "and never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who\r\n",
        "stood open-mouthed below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows\r\n",
        "and devils in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? No one knew, no\r\n",
        "one could imagine; no one--not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von\r\n",
        "Underduk--had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery; so, as\r\n",
        "nothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man replaced his\r\n",

        "a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned. It\r\n",
        "appeared to be--yes! it was undoubtedly a species of balloon; but surely\r\n",

        "the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for\r\n",
        "a similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the good sense of the\r\n",
        "burghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even\r\n",
        "still more reprehensible. Being little or nothing better than a huge\r\n",
        "foolscap turned upside down. And this similitude was regarded as by no\r\n",
        "means lessened when, upon nearer inspection, there was perceived a large\r\n",
        "tassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the\r\n",
        "cone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept\r\n",
        "up a continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse.\r\n",
        "Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine,\r\n",
        "there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver hat, with a brim\r\n",
        "superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a\r\n",
        "silver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens\r\n",
        "of Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and\r\n",
        "indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity;\r\n",
        "while the vrow Grettel Pfaall, upon sight of it, uttered an exclamation\r\n",
        "of joyful surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her good\r\n",
        "man himself. Now this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as\r\n",
        "Pfaall, with three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam\r\n",
        "about five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and\r\n",
        "up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining\r\n",
        "any intelligence concerning them whatsoever. To be sure, some bones\r\n",
        "which were thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking\r\n",
        "rubbish, had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east\r\n",
        "of Rotterdam, and some people went so far as to imagine that in this\r\n",
        "spot a foul murder had been committed, and that the sufferers were in\r\n",
        "all probability Hans Pfaall and his associates. But to return.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to within\r\n",
        "a hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a sufficiently\r\n",
        "distinct view of the person of its occupant. This was in truth a very\r\n",
        "droll little somebody. He could not have been more than two feet in\r\n",
        "height; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient\r\n",
        "to destroy his equilibrium, and tilt him over the edge of his tiny\r\n",
        "car, but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as\r\n",
        "the breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon. The body of the\r\n",
        "little man was more than proportionately broad, giving to his entire\r\n",
        "figure a rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen\r\n",
        "at all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally\r\n",
        "protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car, or to speak more\r\n",
        "properly, in the top of the hat. His hands were enormously large. His\r\n",
        "hair was extremely gray, and collected in a cue behind. His nose was\r\n",
        "prodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant,\r\n",
        "and acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad,\r\n",
        "puffy, and double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a\r\n",
        "semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. This odd little\r\n",
        "gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight\r\n",
        "breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees. His vest\r\n",
        "was of some bright yellow material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily\r\n",
        "on one side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red\r\n",
        "silk handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty\r\n",
        "manner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent\r\n",
        "dimensions.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Having descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet from the\r\n",
        "surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized\r\n",
        "with a fit of trepidation, and appeared disinclined to make any nearer\r\n",
        "approach to terra firma. Throwing out, therefore, a quantity of sand\r\n",
        "from a canvas bag, which, he lifted with great difficulty, he became\r\n",
        "stationary in an instant. He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated\r\n",
        "manner, to extract from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco\r\n",
        "pocket-book. This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with\r\n",
        "an air of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight.\r\n",
        "He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with\r\n",
        "red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely\r\n",
        "at the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von Underduk. His Excellency\r\n",
        "stooped to take it up. But the aeronaut, still greatly discomposed, and\r\n",
        "having apparently no farther business to detain him in Rotterdam, began\r\n",
        "at this moment to make busy preparations for departure; and it being\r\n",
        "necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend,\r\n",
        "the half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without\r\n",
        "taking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of them,\r\n",
        "most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and rolled him over\r\n",
        "and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in the face of every man in\r\n",
        "Rotterdam. It is not to be supposed, however, that the great Underduk\r\n",
        "suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off\r\n",
        "with impunity. It is said, on the contrary, that during each and every\r\n",
        "one of his one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than\r\n",
        "one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to which he\r\n",
        "held fast the whole time with all his might, and to which he intends\r\n",
        "holding fast until the day of his death.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away\r\n",
        "above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that\r\n",
        "from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus lost forever to the\r\n",
        "wondering eyes of the good citizens of Rotterdam. All attention was\r\n",
        "now directed to the letter, the descent of which, and the consequences\r\n",
        "attending thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person and\r\n",
        "personal dignity to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer\r\n",

        "the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that\r\n",
        "sort of thing. People who were formerly, the very best customers in the\r\n",

        "putting an end to my life. Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure\r\n",
        "for contemplation. My house was literally besieged from morning till\r\n",
        "night, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged\r\n",

        "particular who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually\r\n",
        "about my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I\r\n",
        "internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as\r\n",
        "to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but\r\n",
        "the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan\r\n",

        "blunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to dissemble my wrath, and to\r\n",

        "was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether\r\n",
        "those crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the\r\n",
        "appearance, may not often in effect possess all the force, the reality,\r\n",
        "and other inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to\r\n",
        "proceed a step farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a\r\n",
        "purely speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity\r\n",
        "and error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth,\r\n",
        "is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases,\r\n",
        "the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual\r\n",
        "situations wherein she may be found. Nature herself seemed to afford\r\n",
        "me corroboration of these ideas. In the contemplation of the heavenly\r\n",
        "bodies it struck me forcibly that I could not distinguish a star with\r\n",
        "nearly as much precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and\r\n",
        "undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance in\r\n",
        "its vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time aware that this\r\n",
        "apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the visual area being\r\n",
        "less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior\r\n",
        "portions of the retina. This knowledge, and some of another kind, came\r\n",
        "afterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I\r\n",
        "have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and\r\n",
        "forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the\r\n",
        "epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star\r\n",
        "offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force\r\n",
        "of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the\r\n",
        "course which I afterwards pursued.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed. My\r\n",
        "mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night\r\n",
        "buried in meditation. Arising early in the morning, and contriving\r\n",
        "again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I repaired eagerly to the\r\n",
        "bookseller's stall, and laid out what little ready money I possessed,\r\n",
        "in the purchase of some volumes of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy.\r\n",
        "Having arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every spare moment\r\n",
        "to their perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this\r\n",
        "nature as I thought sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the\r\n",
        "intervals of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the\r\n",
        "three creditors who had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally\r\n",
        "succeeded--partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy\r\n",
        "a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance\r\n",
        "upon completion of a little project which I told them I had in view, and\r\n",
        "for assistance in which I solicited their services. By these means--for\r\n",
        "they were ignorant men--I found little difficulty in gaining them over\r\n",
        "to my purpose.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife and\r\n",
        "with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had\r\n",
        "remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under various pretences,\r\n",
        "and without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no\r\n",
        "inconsiderable quantity of ready money. With the means thus accruing I\r\n",

        "of twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a\r\n",
        "large and deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other\r\n",
        "articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of\r\n",
        "extraordinary dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as\r\n",
        "possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the particular\r\n",
        "method of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the twine into\r\n",
        "a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the\r\n",
        "necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common\r\n",
        "barometer with some important modifications, and two astronomical\r\n",
        "instruments not so generally known. I then took opportunities of\r\n",
        "conveying by night, to a retired situation east of Rotterdam, five\r\n",
        "iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons each, and one of a\r\n",
        "larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches in diameter, properly\r\n",
        "shaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of a particular metallic\r\n",
        "substance, or semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns\r\n",
        "of a very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter materials\r\n",
        "is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself--or at\r\n",
        "least never applied to any similar purpose. The secret I would make no\r\n",
        "difficulty in disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of\r\n",
        "Nantz, in France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself.\r\n",
        "The same individual submitted to me, without being at all aware of my\r\n",
        "intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a\r\n",
        "certain animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an\r\n",
        "impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and was\r\n",
        "not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of\r\n",
        "gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention this circumstance,\r\n",
        "because I think it probable that hereafter the individual in question\r\n",
        "may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I have\r\n",

        "\"On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy\r\n",
        "respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug a hole\r\n",
        "two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five\r\n",
        "feet in diameter. In the centre of this circle, being the station\r\n",
        "designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three feet in depth. In\r\n",
        "each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a canister containing\r\n",
        "fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty\r\n",
        "pounds, of cannon powder. These--the keg and canisters--I connected in\r\n",
        "a proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the\r\n",
        "canisters the end of about four feet of slow match, I covered up the\r\n",
        "hole, and placed the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match\r\n",
        "protruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then\r\n",

        "to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the\r\n",
        "purposes to which I intended making it applicable. But, with severe\r\n",
        "labor and unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success\r\n",

        "one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain. It\r\n",
        "had received three coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to\r\n",

        "bookseller's stall; and promising, on my part, to return as soon as\r\n",
        "circumstances would permit, I gave her what little money I had left,\r\n",

        "\"It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was dark; there\r\n",
        "was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals,\r\n",
        "rendered us very uncomfortable. But my chief anxiety was concerning\r\n",
        "the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended,\r\n",
        "began to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable\r\n",
        "to damage. I therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence,\r\n",
        "pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the\r\n",
        "others. They did not cease, however, importuning me with questions as\r\n",

        "dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo. They could\r\n",
        "not perceive, so they said, what good was likely to result from\r\n",
        "their getting wet to the skin, merely to take a part in such horrible\r\n",
        "incantations. I began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might,\r\n",
        "for I verily believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a\r\n",
        "compact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was\r\n",
        "nothing better than it should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of\r\n",

        "it--not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of water,\r\n",
        "and a large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in which much\r\n",
        "nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk. I also secured in\r\n",
        "the car a pair of pigeons and a cat. It was now nearly daybreak, and I\r\n",
        "thought it high time to take my departure. Dropping a lighted cigar on\r\n",

        "legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and blazing metal, that\r\n",
        "my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car,\r\n",
        "trembling with unmitigated terror. Indeed, I now perceived that I had\r\n",
        "entirely overdone the business, and that the main consequences of the\r\n",
        "shock were yet to be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second,\r\n",
        "I felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately\r\n",
        "thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly\r\n",
        "through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder. When\r\n",
        "I afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail to attribute the\r\n",
        "extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its proper\r\n",
        "cause--my situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest\r\n",
        "power. But at the time, I thought only of preserving my life. The\r\n",
        "balloon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled round\r\n",
        "and round with horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering\r\n",
        "like a drunken man, hurled me with great force over the rim of the car,\r\n",
        "and left me dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and\r\n",
        "my face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in\r\n",
        "length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of\r\n",
        "the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most\r\n",
        "providentially entangled. It is impossible--utterly impossible--to form\r\n",
        "any adequate idea of the horror of my situation. I gasped convulsively\r\n",
        "for breath--a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve\r\n",
        "and muscle of my frame--I felt my eyes starting from their sockets--a\r\n",
        "horrible nausea overwhelmed me--and at length I fainted away.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It must,\r\n",
        "however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially\r\n",
        "recovered the sense of existence, I found the day breaking, the balloon\r\n",
        "at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace\r\n",
        "of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast\r\n",
        "horizon. My sensations, however, upon thus recovering, were by no means\r\n",
        "so rife with agony as might have been anticipated. Indeed, there was\r\n",
        "much of incipient madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my\r\n",
        "situation. I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other,\r\n",
        "and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of\r\n",
        "the veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingernails. I afterward\r\n",
        "carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and feeling it with\r\n",
        "minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that it was\r\n",
        "not, as I had more than half suspected, larger than my balloon. Then,\r\n",
        "in a knowing manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets, and, missing\r\n",
        "therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case, endeavored to account\r\n",
        "for their disappearance, and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly\r\n",
        "chagrined. It now occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the\r\n",
        "joint of my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to\r\n",
        "glimmer through my mind. But, strange to say! I was neither astonished\r\n",
        "nor horror-stricken. If I felt any emotion at all, it was a kind of\r\n",
        "chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was about to display in\r\n",
        "extricating myself from this dilemma; and I never, for a moment, looked\r\n",
        "upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt. For a few\r\n",
        "minutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation. I have a\r\n",
        "distinct recollection of frequently compressing my lips, putting\r\n",
        "my forefinger to the side of my nose, and making use of other\r\n",
        "gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in their\r\n",
        "arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance. Having,\r\n",
        "as I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution\r\n",
        "and deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the large\r\n",
        "iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my inexpressibles. This\r\n",
        "buckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with great\r\n",
        "difficulty on their axis. I brought them, however, after some trouble,\r\n",
        "at right angles to the body of the buckle, and was glad to find them\r\n",
        "remain firm in that position. Holding the instrument thus obtained\r\n",
        "within my teeth, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had\r\n",
        "to rest several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it\r\n",
        "was at length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made fast\r\n",
        "the buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly\r\n",
        "around my wrist. Drawing now my body upwards, with a prodigious exertion\r\n",
        "of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial, in throwing\r\n",
        "the buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the\r\n",
        "circular rim of the wicker-work.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an angle\r\n",
        "of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood that I was\r\n",
        "therefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular. So far from\r\n",
        "it, I still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon; for the\r\n",
        "change of situation which I had acquired, had forced the bottom of the\r\n",
        "car considerably outwards from my position, which was accordingly one\r\n",
        "of the most imminent and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however,\r\n",
        "that when I fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen\r\n",

        "point of fact, I was still too stupid to be anything at all, and hung\r\n",
        "for, perhaps, a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner, without\r\n",
        "making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly\r\n",
        "tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment. But this feeling did not fail to\r\n",
        "die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and dismay, and a\r\n",
        "chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin. In fact, the blood so\r\n",
        "long accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat, and which had\r\n",
        "hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium, had now begun\r\n",
        "to retire within their proper channels, and the distinctness which was\r\n",
        "thus added to my perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me\r\n",
        "of the self-possession and courage to encounter it. But this weakness\r\n",
        "was, luckily for me, of no very long duration. In good time came to my\r\n",
        "rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and struggles, I\r\n",
        "jerked my way bodily upwards, till at length, clutching with a vise-like\r\n",
        "grip the long-desired rim, I writhed my person over it, and fell\r\n",
        "headlong and shuddering within the car.\r\n",

        "\"It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself\r\n",
        "sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I then,\r\n",

        "uninjured. My implements were all safe, and, fortunately, I had lost\r\n",

        "the view of attempting a descent, when the recollection of the trick I\r\n",
        "had played the three creditors, and the possible consequences to myself,\r\n",
        "should I return, operated to deter me for the moment. I lay down in the\r\n",
        "bottom of the car, and endeavored to collect my faculties. In this I\r\n",
        "so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood.\r\n",
        "Having no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the operation in\r\n",
        "the best manner I was able, and finally succeeded in opening a vein\r\n",
        "in my right arm, with the blade of my penknife. The blood had hardly\r\n",
        "commenced flowing when I experienced a sensible relief, and by the time\r\n",
        "I had lost about half a moderate basin full, most of the worst symptoms\r\n",
        "had abandoned me entirely. I nevertheless did not think it expedient to\r\n",
        "attempt getting on my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as\r\n",
        "well as I could, I lay still for about a quarter of an hour. At the end\r\n",
        "of this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of any\r\n",
        "kind than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension.\r\n",
        "The difficulty of breathing, however, was diminished in a very slight\r\n",
        "degree, and I found that it would soon be positively necessary to make\r\n",
        "use of my condenser. In the meantime, looking toward the cat, who was\r\n",
        "again snugly stowed away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite\r\n",
        "surprise, that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to\r\n",
        "bring into light a litter of three little kittens. This was an addition\r\n",
        "to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I was\r\n",
        "pleased at the occurrence. It would afford me a chance of bringing to a\r\n",
        "kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more than anything else,\r\n",
        "had influenced me in attempting this ascension. I had imagined that the\r\n",
        "habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of\r\n",
        "the earth was the cause, or nearly so, of the pain attending animal\r\n",
        "existence at a distance above the surface. Should the kittens be found\r\n",
        "to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must\r\n",
        "consider my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon\r\n",
        "as a strong confirmation of my idea.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"By eight o'clock I had actually attained an elevation of seventeen\r\n",
        "miles above the surface of the earth. Thus it seemed to me evident that\r\n",

        "would have been apparent in a slight degree even had I not discharged\r\n",
        "the ballast which I did. The pains in my head and ears returned, at\r\n",
        "intervals, with violence, and I still continued to bleed occasionally at\r\n",
        "the nose; but, upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have\r\n",
        "been expected. I breathed, however, at every moment, with more and\r\n",
        "more difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a troublesome\r\n",
        "spasmodic action of the chest. I now unpacked the condensing apparatus,\r\n",

        "could see, lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean, which\r\n",
        "every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already\r\n",
        "to assume a slight appearance of convexity. At a vast distance to the\r\n",
        "eastward, although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great\r\n",
        "Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a small\r\n",
        "portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa. Of individual\r\n",
        "edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the proudest cities of\r\n",

        "dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars, spread\r\n",
        "itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended, until its\r\n",
        "entire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss\r\n",
        "of the horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes\r\n",
        "of the mighty cataract. Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the\r\n",

        "however, no attempt to descend as I had expected, but struggled with\r\n",
        "great vehemence to get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and\r\n",
        "piercing cries. He at length succeeded in regaining his former station\r\n",
        "on the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his\r\n",
        "breast, and he fell dead within the car. The other one did not prove so\r\n",
        "unfortunate. To prevent his following the example of his companion, and\r\n",
        "accomplishing a return, I threw him downward with all my force, and was\r\n",
        "pleased to find him continue his descent, with great velocity, making\r\n",
        "use of his wings with ease, and in a perfectly natural manner. In a very\r\n",
        "short time he was out of sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in\r\n",
        "safety. Puss, who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness,\r\n",
        "now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much\r\n",

        "require some little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to\r\n",
        "bear in mind that my object, in the first place, was to surround myself\r\n",
        "and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere\r\n",
        "in which I was existing, with the intention of introducing within this\r\n",
        "barricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere\r\n",
        "sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration. With this object\r\n",
        "in view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible\r\n",
        "gum-elastic bag. In this bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the\r\n",
        "entire car was in a manner placed. That is to say, it (the bag) was\r\n",
        "drawn over the whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along\r\n",
        "the outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work\r\n",
        "is attached. Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a complete\r\n",
        "enclosure on all sides, and at bottom, it was now necessary to fasten\r\n",
        "up its top or mouth, by passing its material over the hoop of the\r\n",
        "net-work--in other words, between the net-work and the hoop. But if the\r\n",
        "net-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was\r\n",
        "to sustain the car in the meantime? Now the net-work was not permanently\r\n",
        "fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or\r\n",
        "nooses. I therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving\r\n",
        "the car suspended by the remainder. Having thus inserted a portion of\r\n",
        "the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I refastened the loops--not\r\n",
        "to the hoop, for that would have been impossible, since the cloth\r\n",
        "now intervened--but to a series of large buttons, affixed to the cloth\r\n",
        "itself, about three feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals\r\n",
        "between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals\r\n",
        "between the loops. This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened\r\n",
        "from the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the\r\n",
        "disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons. In this way\r\n",
        "it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the\r\n",
        "net-work and the hoop. It is evident that the hoop would now drop down\r\n",
        "within the car, while the whole weight of the car itself, with all its\r\n",
        "contents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons. This,\r\n",
        "at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it was by no\r\n",
        "means so, for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but\r\n",
        "so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was\r\n",
        "supported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car and contents been\r\n",
        "three times heavier than they were, I should not have been at\r\n",
        "all uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of\r\n",
        "gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by means of\r\n",
        "three light poles prepared for the occasion. This was done, of course,\r\n",
        "to keep the bag distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part\r\n",
        "of the net-work in its proper situation. All that now remained was to\r\n",
        "fasten up the mouth of the enclosure; and this was readily accomplished\r\n",
        "by gathering the folds of the material together, and twisting them up\r\n",
        "very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.\r\n",

        "window, of the same kind, and corresponding with a small aperture in the\r\n",
        "floor of the car itself. This enabled me to see perpendicularly\r\n",
        "down, but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance\r\n",
        "overhead, on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening\r\n",
        "there, and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see\r\n",
        "no objects situated directly in my zenith. This, of course, was a matter\r\n",
        "of little consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at\r\n",

        "tube of the condenser, the body of the machine being, of course, within\r\n",
        "the chamber of gum-elastic. Through this tube a quantity of the rare\r\n",
        "atmosphere circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the\r\n",

        "repeated several times, at length filled the chamber with atmosphere\r\n",
        "proper for all the purposes of respiration. But in so confined a space\r\n",
        "it would, in a short time, necessarily become foul, and unfit for use\r\n",
        "from frequent contact with the lungs. It was then ejected by a small\r\n",

        "accomplished all at once, but in a gradual manner--the valve being\r\n",
        "opened only for a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two\r\n",
        "strokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the\r\n",
        "atmosphere ejected. For the sake of experiment I had put the cat and\r\n",
        "kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car to a button\r\n",
        "at the bottom, close by the valve, through which I could feed them at\r\n",

        "hour during the whole period of my repose. It would require but five\r\n",
        "minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner, and\r\n",
        "the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself\r\n",
        "at the proper moment for so doing. But this was a question which, I am\r\n",
        "willing to confess, occasioned me no little trouble in its solution. To\r\n",
        "be sure, I had heard of the student who, to prevent his falling asleep\r\n",

        "descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair,\r\n",
        "served effectually to startle him up, if, at any moment, he should\r\n",
        "be overcome with drowsiness. My own case, however, was very different\r\n",
        "indeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to\r\n",
        "keep awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time.\r\n",
        "I at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple as it may\r\n",

        "above sketchy trifle and the celebrated \"Moon-Story\" of Mr. Locke; but\r\n",
        "as both have the character of _hoaxes _(although the one is in a tone of\r\n",
        "banter, the other of downright earnest), and as both hoaxes are on the\r\n",
        "same subject, the moon--moreover, as both attempt to give plausibility\r\n",
        "by scientific detail--the author of \"Hans Pfaall\" thinks it necessary to\r\n",
        "say, in _self-defence, _that his own _jeu d'esprit _was published in the\r\n",
        "\"Southern Literary Messenger\" about three weeks before the commencement\r\n",
        "of Mr. L's in the \"New York Sun.\" Fancying a likeness which, perhaps,\r\n",
        "does not exist, some of the New York papers copied \"Hans Pfaall,\" and\r\n",
        "collated it with the \"Moon-Hoax,\" by way of detecting the writer of the\r\n",
        "one in the writer of the other.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "As many more persons were actually gulled by the \"Moon-Hoax\" than would\r\n",
        "be willing to acknowledge the fact, it may here afford some little\r\n",
        "amusement to show why no one should have been deceived-to point out\r\n",
        "those particulars of the story which should have been sufficient to\r\n",
        "establish its real character. Indeed, however rich the imagination\r\n",
        "displayed in this ingenious fiction, it wanted much of the force which\r\n",
        "might have been given it by a more scrupulous attention to facts and\r\n",
        "to general analogy. That the public were misled, even for an instant,\r\n",

        "The moon's distance from the earth is, in round numbers, 240,000 miles.\r\n",
        "If we desire to ascertain how near, apparently, a lens would bring the\r\n",
        "satellite (or any distant object), we, of course, have but to divide the\r\n",
        "distance by the magnifying or, more strictly, by the space-penetrating\r\n",
        "power of the glass. Mr. L. makes his lens have a power of 42,000 times.\r\n",
        "By this divide 240,000 (the moon's real distance), and we have five\r\n",
        "miles and five sevenths, as the apparent distance. No animal at all\r\n",
        "could be seen so far; much less the minute points particularized in the\r\n",
        "story. Mr. L. speaks about Sir John Herschel's perceiving flowers (the\r\n",
        "Papaver rheas, etc.), and even detecting the color and the shape of the\r\n",
        "eyes of small birds. Shortly before, too, he has himself observed that\r\n",
        "the lens would not render perceptible objects of less than eighteen\r\n",
        "inches in diameter; but even this, as I have said, is giving the glass\r\n",

        "dwarfish. No trees of any magnitude are to be seen. Near the western\r\n",
        "extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable\r\n",
        "frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives from\r\n",
        "Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto;\r\n",
        "but the whole island, with the exception of this western point, and\r\n",
        "a line of hard, white beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense\r\n",
        "undergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists\r\n",
        "of England. The shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty\r\n",
        "feet, and forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening the air with\r\n",
        "its fragrance.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In the inmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or more\r\n",
        "remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which\r\n",
        "he occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his acquaintance.\r\n",
        "This soon ripened into friendship--for there was much in the recluse\r\n",
        "to excite interest and esteem. I found him well educated, with unusual\r\n",
        "powers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and subject to perverse\r\n",
        "moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy. He had with him many\r\n",
        "books, but rarely employed them. His chief amusements were gunning and\r\n",
        "fishing, or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles, in quest\r\n",
        "of shells or entomological specimens;--his collection of the latter\r\n",
        "might have been envied by a Swammerdamm. In these excursions he was\r\n",
        "usually accompanied by an old negro, called Jupiter, who had been\r\n",
        "manumitted before the reverses of the family, but who could be induced,\r\n",
        "neither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what he considered his\r\n",
        "right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young \"Massa Will.\" It\r\n",
        "is not improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be\r\n",
        "somewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy\r\n",
        "into Jupiter, with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the\r\n",
        "wanderer.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The winters in the latitude of Sullivan's Island are seldom very severe,\r\n",
        "and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is\r\n",
        "considered necessary. About the middle of October, 18-, there occurred,\r\n",
        "however, a day of remarkable chilliness. Just before sunset I scrambled\r\n",
        "my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend, whom I had\r\n",
        "not visited for several weeks--my residence being, at that time,\r\n",
        "in Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the Island, while the\r\n",
        "facilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of\r\n",
        "the present day. Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom,\r\n",
        "and getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted,\r\n",
        "unlocked the door and went in. A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth.\r\n",
        "It was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. I threw off an\r\n",
        "overcoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently\r\n",
        "the arrival of my hosts.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Soon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome.\r\n",
        "Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some\r\n",
        "marsh-hens for supper. Legrand was in one of his fits--how else shall\r\n",
        "I term them?--of enthusiasm. He had found an unknown bivalve, forming\r\n",
        "a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and secured, with\r\n",
        "Jupiter's assistance, a scarab\u00e6us which he believed to be totally new,\r\n",
        "but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"And why not to-night?\" I asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and\r\n",
        "wishing the whole tribe of scarab\u00e6i at the devil.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Ah, if I had only known you were here!\" said Legrand, \"but it's so long\r\n",
        "since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a visit\r\n",
        "this very night of all others? As I was coming home I met Lieutenant\r\n",
        "G--, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will\r\n",
        "be impossible for you to see it until the morning. Stay here to-night,\r\n",
        "and I will send Jup down for it at sunrise. It is the loveliest thing in\r\n",
        "creation!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"What?--sunrise?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Nonsense! no!--the bug. It is of a brilliant gold color--about the size\r\n",
        "of a large hickory-nut--with two jet black spots near one extremity of\r\n",
        "the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other. The antenn\u00e6 are--\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Dey aint no tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,\" here\r\n",
        "interrupted Jupiter; \"de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery bit of him,\r\n",
        "inside and all, sep him wing--neber feel half so hebby a bug in my\r\n",
        "life.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Well, suppose it is, Jup,\" replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly,\r\n",
        "it seemed to me, than the case demanded, \"is that any reason for your\r\n",
        "letting the birds burn? The color\"--here he turned to me--\"is really\r\n",
        "almost enough to warrant Jupiter's idea. You never saw a more brilliant\r\n",
        "metallic lustre than the scales emit--but of this you cannot judge\r\n",
        "till tomorrow. In the mean time I can give you some idea of the shape.\"\r\n",
        "Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were a pen and\r\n",
        "ink, but no paper. He looked for some in a drawer, but found none.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Never mind,\" said he at length, \"this will answer;\" and he drew from\r\n",
        "his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap,\r\n",
        "and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen. While he did this, I\r\n",
        "retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly. When the design\r\n",
        "was complete, he handed it to me without rising. As I received it, a\r\n",
        "loud growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door. Jupiter\r\n",
        "opened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in,\r\n",
        "leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown\r\n",
        "him much attention during previous visits. When his gambols were over, I\r\n",
        "looked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not a little\r\n",
        "puzzled at what my friend had depicted.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Well!\" I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, \"this is a\r\n",
        "strange scarab\u00e6us, I must confess: new to me: never saw anything like it\r\n",
        "before--unless it was a skull, or a death's-head--which it more nearly\r\n",
        "resembles than anything else that has come under my observation.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"A death's-head!\" echoed Legrand--\"Oh--yes--well, it has something of\r\n",
        "that appearance upon paper, no doubt. The two upper black spots look\r\n",
        "like eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth--and then\r\n",
        "the shape of the whole is oval.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Perhaps so,\" said I; \"but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. I must\r\n",
        "wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its\r\n",
        "personal appearance.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Well, I don't know,\" said he, a little nettled, \"I draw\r\n",
        "tolerably--should do it at least--have had good masters, and flatter\r\n",
        "myself that I am not quite a blockhead.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,\" said I, \"this is a very\r\n",
        "passable skull--indeed, I may say that it is a very excellent skull,\r\n",
        "according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology--and\r\n",
        "your scarab\u00e6us must be the queerest scarab\u00e6us in the world if it\r\n",
        "resembles it. Why, we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition\r\n",
        "upon this hint. I presume you will call the bug scarab\u00e6us caput hominis,\r\n",
        "or something of that kind--there are many similar titles in the Natural\r\n",
        "Histories. But where are the antenn\u00e6 you spoke of?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"The antenn\u00e6!\" said Legrand, who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm\r\n",
        "upon the subject; \"I am sure you must see the antenn\u00e6. I made them\r\n",
        "as distinct as they are in the original insect, and I presume that is\r\n",
        "sufficient.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Well, well,\" I said, \"perhaps you have--still I don't see them;\" and\r\n",
        "I handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to ruffle\r\n",
        "his temper; but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken; his\r\n",
        "ill humor puzzled me--and, as for the drawing of the beetle, there\r\n",
        "were positively no antenn\u00e6 visible, and the whole did bear a very close\r\n",
        "resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death's-head.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it,\r\n",
        "apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design\r\n",
        "seemed suddenly to rivet his attention. In an instant his face grew\r\n",
        "violently red--in another as excessively pale. For some minutes he\r\n",
        "continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. At length he\r\n",
        "arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon\r\n",
        "a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room. Here again he made an\r\n",
        "anxious examination of the paper; turning it in all directions. He said\r\n",
        "nothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought\r\n",
        "it prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any\r\n",
        "comment. Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the\r\n",
        "paper carefully in it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he\r\n",
        "locked. He now grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air\r\n",
        "of enthusiasm had quite disappeared. Yet he seemed not so much sulky as\r\n",
        "abstracted. As the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in\r\n",
        "reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse him. It had been my\r\n",
        "intention to pass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before,\r\n",
        "but, seeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave. He\r\n",
        "did not press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with\r\n",
        "even more than his usual cordiality.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen\r\n",
        "nothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his\r\n",
        "man, Jupiter. I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited,\r\n",
        "and I feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend.\r\n",

        "the suspicions already entertained. His countenance was pale even to\r\n",
        "ghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre. After\r\n",
        "some inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not knowing what\r\n",
        "better to say, if he had yet obtained the scarab\u00e6us from Lieutenant\r\n",

        "\"Oh, yes,\" he replied, coloring violently, \"I got it from him the next\r\n",

        "know that Jupiter is quite right about it?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"In what way?\" I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"In supposing it to be a bug of real gold.\" He said this with an air of\r\n",
        "profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"This bug is to make my fortune,\" he continued, with a triumphant smile,\r\n",
        "\"to reinstate me in my family possessions. Is it any wonder, then, that\r\n",
        "I prize it? Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me, I have\r\n",
        "only to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of which it is\r\n",

        "stately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was\r\n",
        "enclosed. It was a beautiful scarab\u00e6us, and, at that time, unknown to\r\n",
        "naturalists--of course a great prize in a scientific point of view.\r\n",
        "There were two round, black spots near one extremity of the back, and\r\n",
        "a long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy,\r\n",
        "with all the appearance of burnished gold. The weight of the insect\r\n",
        "was very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I could\r\n",
        "hardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it; but what to make of\r\n",
        "Legrand's concordance with that opinion, I could not, for the life of\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"Very easily. Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the\r\n",

        "complaisance. His demeanor was dogged in the extreme, and \"dat deuced\r\n",

        "my own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand\r\n",
        "contented himself with the scarab\u00e6us, which he carried attached to the\r\n",
        "end of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air of a\r\n",
        "conjuror, as he went. When I observed this last, plain evidence of my\r\n",
        "friend's aberration of mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears. I\r\n",
        "thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at least for the present,\r\n",
        "or until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of\r\n",
        "success. In the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in\r\n",
        "regard to the object of the expedition. Having succeeded in inducing\r\n",
        "me to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any\r\n",
        "topic of minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other\r\n",
        "reply than \"we shall see!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff; and,\r\n",
        "ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main land, proceeded in a\r\n",
        "northwesterly direction, through a tract of country excessively wild and\r\n",
        "desolate, where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen. Legrand led\r\n",

        "inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and\r\n",
        "interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil,\r\n",
        "and in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the\r\n",
        "valleys below, merely by the support of the trees against which they\r\n",
        "reclined. Deep ravines, in various directions, gave an air of still\r\n",
        "sterner solemnity to the scene.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown\r\n",
        "with brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have\r\n",
        "been impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by\r\n",
        "direction of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of\r\n",
        "an enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks,\r\n",
        "upon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I\r\n",
        "had then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide\r\n",
        "spread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance.\r\n",
        "When we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if\r\n",
        "he thought he could climb it. The old man seemed a little staggered\r\n",
        "by the question, and for some moments made no reply. At length he\r\n",
        "approached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with\r\n",
        "minute attention. When he had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,\r\n",

        "\"Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "of the extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the insect as far\r\n",
        "from his person as circumstances would permit, prepared to ascend the\r\n",

        "magnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and\r\n",
        "often rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its\r\n",
        "riper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs\r\n",
        "make their appearance on the stem. Thus the difficulty of ascension, in\r\n",
        "the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality. Embracing the\r\n",
        "huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing\r\n",
        "with his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes upon\r\n",
        "others, Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at length\r\n",
        "wriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to consider the\r\n",
        "whole business as virtually accomplished. The risk of the achievement\r\n",
        "was, in fact, now over, although the climber was some sixty or seventy\r\n",

        "be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it. Presently his\r\n",

        "by the two points of the tree and the peg, for the distance of fifty\r\n",
        "feet--Jupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe. At the spot\r\n",
        "thus attained a second peg was driven, and about this, as a centre, a\r\n",
        "rude circle, about four feet in diameter, described. Taking now a spade\r\n",
        "himself, and giving one to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to\r\n",
        "set about digging as quickly as possible.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "To speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any\r\n",
        "time, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have declined\r\n",
        "it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued with the\r\n",
        "exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was fearful\r\n",
        "of disturbing my poor friend's equanimity by a refusal. Could I have\r\n",
        "depended, indeed, upon Jupiter's aid, I would have had no hesitation in\r\n",

        "of the old negro's disposition, to hope that he would assist me, under\r\n",
        "any circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. I made no\r\n",
        "doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable\r\n",
        "Southern superstitions about money buried, and that his phantasy had\r\n",
        "received confirmation by the finding of the scarab\u00e6us, or, perhaps, by\r\n",
        "Jupiter's obstinacy in maintaining it to be \"a bug of real gold.\" A\r\n",
        "mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such\r\n",
        "suggestions--especially if chiming in with favorite preconceived\r\n",
        "ideas--and then I called to mind the poor fellow's speech about the\r\n",
        "beetle's being \"the index of his fortune.\" Upon the whole, I was sadly\r\n",
        "vexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make a virtue of\r\n",
        "necessity--to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to convince the\r\n",
        "visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions he\r\n",
        "entertained.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy\r\n",
        "a more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and\r\n",
        "implements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we\r\n",
        "composed, and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared\r\n",
        "to any interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our\r\n",
        "whereabouts.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We dug very steadily for two hours. Little was said; and our chief\r\n",
        "embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding\r\n",
        "interest in our proceedings. He, at length, became so obstreperous\r\n",
        "that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in\r\n",
        "the vicinity;--or, rather, this was the apprehension of Legrand;--for\r\n",
        "myself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have\r\n",
        "enabled me to get the wanderer home. The noise was, at length, very\r\n",
        "effectually silenced by Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a\r\n",
        "dogged air of deliberation, tied the brute's mouth up with one of his\r\n",
        "suspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "When the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five\r\n",
        "feet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest. A general pause\r\n",
        "ensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an end. Legrand,\r\n",
        "however, although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow\r\n",
        "thoughtfully and recommenced. We had excavated the entire circle of four\r\n",
        "feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to the\r\n",
        "farther depth of two feet. Still nothing appeared. The gold-seeker, whom\r\n",
        "I sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest\r\n",
        "disappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly\r\n",
        "and reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the\r\n",
        "beginning of his labor. In the mean time I made no remark. Jupiter, at a\r\n",
        "signal from his master, began to gather up his tools. This done, and the\r\n",
        "dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in profound silence towards home.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a\r\n",
        "loud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar.\r\n",
        "The astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent,\r\n",
        "let fall the spades, and fell upon his knees.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"You scoundrel,\" said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from between\r\n",
        "his clenched teeth--\"you infernal black villain!--speak, I tell\r\n",
        "you!--answer me this instant, without prevarication!--which--which is\r\n",
        "your left eye?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?\" roared\r\n",
        "the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right organ of vision,\r\n",
        "and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in immediate\r\n",
        "dread of his master's attempt at a gouge.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I thought so!--I knew it! hurrah!\" vociferated Legrand, letting the\r\n",
        "negro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracols, much to the\r\n",
        "astonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked, mutely,\r\n",
        "from his master to myself, and then from myself to his master.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Come! we must go back,\" said the latter, \"the game's not up yet;\" and\r\n",
        "he again led the way to the tulip-tree.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Jupiter,\" said he, when we reached its foot, \"come here! was the skull\r\n",
        "nailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with the face to the\r\n",
        "limb?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes good,\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"Twas dis eye, massa--de lef eye--jis as you tell me,\" and here it was\r\n",
        "his right eye that the negro indicated.\r\n",

        "Here my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw,\r\n",
        "certain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot\r\n",
        "where the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward\r\n",
        "of its former position. Taking, now, the tape measure from the nearest\r\n",
        "point of the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension\r\n",
        "in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was indicated,\r\n",
        "removed, by several yards, from the point at which we had been digging.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Around the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former\r\n",
        "instance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades.\r\n",
        "I was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had occasioned\r\n",
        "the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great aversion from the\r\n",
        "labor imposed. I had become most unaccountably interested--nay, even\r\n",
        "excited. Perhaps there was something, amid all the extravagant demeanor\r\n",
        "of Legrand--some air of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed\r\n",
        "me. I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself actually looking,\r\n",
        "with something that very much resembled expectation, for the fancied\r\n",
        "treasure, the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion. At\r\n",
        "a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and\r\n",
        "when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again\r\n",
        "interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog. His uneasiness, in the\r\n",
        "first instance, had been, evidently, but the result of playfulness or\r\n",
        "caprice, but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone. Upon Jupiter's\r\n",
        "again attempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping\r\n",
        "into the hole, tore up the mould frantically with his claws. In a few\r\n",
        "seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete\r\n",
        "skeletons, intermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared\r\n",
        "to be the dust of decayed woollen. One or two strokes of a spade\r\n",
        "upturned the blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther,\r\n",
        "three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "At sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but\r\n",
        "the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment He\r\n",
        "urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words were hardly\r\n",
        "uttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having caught the toe of my\r\n",
        "boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more\r\n",
        "intense excitement. During this interval we had fairly unearthed an\r\n",
        "oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and\r\n",
        "wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing\r\n",
        "process--perhaps that of the Bi-chloride of Mercury. This box was three\r\n",
        "feet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet deep. It\r\n",
        "was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind\r\n",
        "of open trelliswork over the whole. On each side of the chest, near the\r\n",
        "top, were three rings of iron--six in all--by means of which a firm hold\r\n",
        "could be obtained by six persons. Our utmost united endeavors served\r\n",
        "only to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed. We at once saw\r\n",
        "the impossibility of removing so great a weight. Luckily, the sole\r\n",
        "fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts. These we drew\r\n",
        "back--trembling and panting with anxiety. In an instant, a treasure of\r\n",
        "incalculable value lay gleaming before us. As the rays of the lanterns\r\n",
        "fell within the pit, there flashed upwards a glow and a glare, from a\r\n",
        "confused heap of gold and of jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "I shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed.\r\n",
        "Amazement was, of course, predominant. Legrand appeared exhausted with\r\n",
        "excitement, and spoke very few words. Jupiter's countenance wore, for\r\n",
        "some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in nature of things,\r\n",
        "for any negro's visage to assume. He seemed stupified--thunderstricken.\r\n",
        "Presently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying his naked\r\n",
        "arms up to the elbows in gold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the\r\n",
        "luxury of a bath. At length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a\r\n",
        "soliloquy,\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de putty goole bug! de poor little\r\n",
        "goole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style! Aint you shamed ob\r\n",
        "yourself, nigger?--answer me dat!\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and valet\r\n",
        "to the expediency of removing the treasure. It was growing late, and\r\n",
        "it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get every thing housed\r\n",
        "before daylight. It was difficult to say what should be done, and much\r\n",
        "time was spent in deliberation--so confused were the ideas of all. We,\r\n",
        "finally, lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents,\r\n",
        "when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the hole. The\r\n",
        "articles taken out were deposited among the brambles, and the dog\r\n",
        "left to guard them, with strict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any\r\n",
        "pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return.\r\n",
        "We then hurriedly made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in\r\n",
        "safety, but after excessive toil, at one o'clock in the morning. Worn\r\n",
        "out as we were, it was not in human nature to do more immediately. We\r\n",
        "rested until two, and had supper; starting for the hills immediately\r\n",
        "afterwards, armed with three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon\r\n",
        "the premises. A little before four we arrived at the pit, divided the\r\n",
        "remainder of the booty, as equally as might be, among us, and, leaving\r\n",
        "the holes unfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for the second\r\n",
        "time, we deposited our golden burthens, just as the first faint streaks\r\n",
        "of the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "We were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the\r\n",
        "time denied us repose. After an unquiet slumber of some three or four\r\n",
        "hours' duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of\r\n",
        "our treasure.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and the\r\n",
        "greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. There had\r\n",
        "been nothing like order or arrangement. Every thing had been heaped\r\n",
        "in promiscuously. Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves\r\n",
        "possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed. In\r\n",
        "coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand\r\n",
        "dollars--estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could,\r\n",
        "by the tables of the period. There was not a particle of silver. All was\r\n",
        "gold of antique date and of great variety--French, Spanish, and German\r\n",
        "money, with a few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had\r\n",
        "never seen specimens before. There were several very large and heavy\r\n",
        "coins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. There\r\n",
        "was no American money. The value of the jewels we found more difficulty\r\n",
        "in estimating. There were diamonds--some of them exceedingly large and\r\n",
        "fine--a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen\r\n",
        "rubies of remarkable brilliancy;--three hundred and ten emeralds, all\r\n",
        "very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal. These stones had\r\n",
        "all been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest. The\r\n",
        "settings themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold,\r\n",
        "appeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent\r\n",
        "identification. Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid\r\n",
        "gold ornaments;--nearly two hundred massive finger and earrings;--rich\r\n",
        "chains--thirty of these, if I remember;--eighty-three very large and\r\n",
        "heavy crucifixes;--five gold censers of great value;--a prodigious\r\n",
        "golden punch bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and\r\n",
        "Bacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and\r\n",
        "many other smaller articles which I cannot recollect. The weight of\r\n",
        "these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and\r\n",
        "in this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb\r\n",
        "gold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars,\r\n",
        "if one. Many of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless; the\r\n",
        "works having suffered, more or less, from corrosion--but all were richly\r\n",
        "jewelled and in cases of great worth. We estimated the entire contents\r\n",
        "of the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and upon\r\n",
        "the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained\r\n",
        "for our own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the\r\n",
        "treasure. When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the\r\n",
        "intense excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Legrand,\r\n",
        "who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this\r\n",
        "most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the\r\n",
        "circumstances connected with it.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"You remember;\" said he, \"the night when I handed you the rough sketch I\r\n",
        "had made of the scarab\u00e6us. You recollect also, that I became quite vexed\r\n",
        "at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a death's-head. When you\r\n",
        "first made this assertion I thought you were jesting; but afterwards\r\n",
        "I called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect, and\r\n",
        "admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact.\r\n",
        "Still, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me--for I am considered\r\n",
        "a good artist--and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of\r\n",
        "parchment, I was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the\r\n",
        "fire.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"The scrap of paper, you mean,\" said I.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed it\r\n",
        "to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once,\r\n",
        "to be a piece of very thin parchment. It was quite dirty, you remember.\r\n",
        "Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell\r\n",
        "upon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my\r\n",
        "astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure of a death's-head\r\n",
        "just where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of the beetle. For\r\n",
        "a moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy. I knew that my\r\n",
        "design was very different in detail from this--although there was a\r\n",
        "certain similarity in general outline. Presently I took a candle, and\r\n",
        "seating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to scrutinize the\r\n",
        "parchment more closely. Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch\r\n",
        "upon the reverse, just as I had made it. My first idea, now, was mere\r\n",
        "surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline--at the singular\r\n",
        "coincidence involved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should have\r\n",
        "been a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath\r\n",
        "my figure of the scarab\u00e6us, and that this skull, not only in outline,\r\n",
        "but in size, should so closely resemble my drawing. I say the\r\n",
        "singularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified me for a time.\r\n",
        "This is the usual effect of such coincidences. The mind struggles to\r\n",
        "establish a connexion--a sequence of cause and effect--and, being\r\n",
        "unable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis. But, when I\r\n",
        "recovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction\r\n",
        "which startled me even far more than the coincidence. I began\r\n",
        "distinctly, positively, to remember that there had been no drawing upon\r\n",
        "the parchment when I made my sketch of the scarab\u00e6us. I became perfectly\r\n",
        "certain of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then\r\n",
        "the other, in search of the cleanest spot. Had the skull been then\r\n",
        "there, of course I could not have failed to notice it. Here was indeed\r\n",
        "a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that early\r\n",
        "moment, there seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and\r\n",
        "secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of\r\n",
        "that truth which last night's adventure brought to so magnificent a\r\n",
        "demonstration. I arose at once, and putting the parchment securely away,\r\n",
        "dismissed all farther reflection until I should be alone.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself\r\n",
        "to a more methodical investigation of the affair. In the first place\r\n",
        "I considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my\r\n",
        "possession. The spot where we discovered the scarabaeus was on the coast\r\n",
        "of the main land, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short\r\n",
        "distance above high water mark. Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a\r\n",
        "sharp bite, which caused me to let it drop. Jupiter, with his accustomed\r\n",
        "caution, before seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked\r\n",
        "about him for a leaf, or something of that nature, by which to take hold\r\n",
        "of it. It was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the\r\n",
        "scrap of parchment, which I then supposed to be paper. It was lying half\r\n",
        "buried in the sand, a corner sticking up. Near the spot where we found\r\n",
        "it, I observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a\r\n",
        "ship's long boat. The wreck seemed to have been there for a very great\r\n",
        "while; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and\r\n",
        "gave it to me. Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way met\r\n",
        "Lieutenant G-. I showed him the insect, and he begged me to let him\r\n",
        "take it to the fort. Upon my consenting, he thrust it forthwith into his\r\n",
        "waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been wrapped,\r\n",
        "and which I had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection.\r\n",
        "Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure\r\n",
        "of the prize at once--you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects\r\n",
        "connected with Natural History. At the same time, without being\r\n",
        "conscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making\r\n",
        "a sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept.\r\n",
        "I looked in the drawer, and found none there. I searched my pockets,\r\n",
        "hoping to find an old letter, when my hand fell upon the parchment. I\r\n",
        "thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession; for\r\n",
        "the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"No doubt you will think me fanciful--but I had already established a\r\n",
        "kind of connexion. I had put together two links of a great chain. There\r\n",
        "was a boat lying upon a sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a\r\n",
        "parchment--not a paper--with a skull depicted upon it. You will,\r\n",
        "of course, ask 'where is the connexion?' I reply that the skull, or\r\n",
        "death's-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate. The flag of the\r\n",
        "death's head is hoisted in all engagements.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper. Parchment\r\n",
        "is durable--almost imperishable. Matters of little moment are rarely\r\n",
        "consigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing\r\n",
        "or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper. This reflection\r\n",
        "suggested some meaning--some relevancy--in the death's-head. I did not\r\n",
        "fail to observe, also, the form of the parchment. Although one of its\r\n",
        "corners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the\r\n",
        "original form was oblong. It was just such a slip, indeed, as might\r\n",
        "have been chosen for a memorandum--for a record of something to be long\r\n",
        "remembered and carefully preserved.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"But,\" I interposed, \"you say that the skull was not upon the parchment\r\n",

        "connexion between the boat and the skull--since this latter, according\r\n",
        "to your own admission, must have been designed (God only knows how or by\r\n",
        "whom) at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarab\u00e6us?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this\r\n",
        "point, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving. My steps were\r\n",
        "sure, and could afford but a single result. I reasoned, for example,\r\n",
        "thus: When I drew the scarab\u00e6us, there was no skull apparent upon\r\n",
        "the parchment. When I had completed the drawing I gave it to you, and\r\n",
        "observed you narrowly until you returned it. You, therefore, did not\r\n",
        "design the skull, and no one else was present to do it. Then it was not\r\n",
        "done by human agency. And nevertheless it was done.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and did\r\n",
        "remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred about\r\n",
        "the period in question. The weather was chilly (oh rare and happy\r\n",
        "accident!), and a fire was blazing upon the hearth. I was heated with\r\n",
        "exercise and sat near the table. You, however, had drawn a chair close\r\n",
        "to the chimney. Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as you\r\n",
        "were in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered,\r\n",
        "and leaped upon your shoulders. With your left hand you caressed him and\r\n",
        "kept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted to\r\n",
        "fall listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the fire.\r\n",
        "At one moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was about to\r\n",
        "caution you, but, before I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were\r\n",
        "engaged in its examination. When I considered all these particulars, I\r\n",
        "doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to\r\n",
        "light, upon the parchment, the skull which I saw designed upon it. You\r\n",
        "are well aware that chemical preparations exist, and have existed time\r\n",
        "out of mind, by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper\r\n",
        "or vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when\r\n",
        "subjected to the action of fire. Zaffre, digested in aqua regia, and\r\n",
        "diluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed; a\r\n",
        "green tint results. The regulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre,\r\n",
        "gives a red. These colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after\r\n",
        "the material written upon cools, but again become apparent upon the\r\n",
        "re-application of heat.\r\n",

        "\"I now scrutinized the death's-head with care. Its outer edges--the\r\n",
        "edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum--were far more\r\n",
        "distinct than the others. It was clear that the action of the caloric\r\n",
        "had been imperfect or unequal. I immediately kindled a fire, and\r\n",
        "subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat. At first,\r\n",
        "the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull;\r\n",
        "but, upon persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at\r\n",
        "the corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the\r\n",
        "death's-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to\r\n",
        "be a goat. A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended\r\n",
        "for a kid.\"\r\n",

        "one Captain Kidd. I at once looked upon the figure of the animal as a\r\n",
        "kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature. I say signature; because\r\n",
        "its position upon the vellum suggested this idea. The death's-head at\r\n",
        "the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same manner, the air of a\r\n",

        "belief;--but do you know that Jupiter's silly words, about the bug\r\n",
        "being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect upon my fancy? And then the\r\n",

        "foundation in fact. And that the rumors have existed so long and so\r\n",
        "continuous, could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the\r\n",

        "not about money-finders. Had the pirate recovered his money, there the\r\n",
        "affair would have dropped. It seemed to me that some accident--say the\r\n",
        "loss of a memorandum indicating its locality--had deprived him of the\r\n",
        "means of recovering it, and that this accident had become known to his\r\n",

        "reached it; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we\r\n",
        "resided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons\r\n",
        "gazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from\r\n",
        "the opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with\r\n",
        "a gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding\r\n",
        "panel in the window, indicating a _loge de concierge._ Before going in\r\n",
        "we walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning,\r\n",
        "passed in the rear of the building--Dupin, meanwhile examining the whole\r\n",
        "neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for\r\n",
        "which I could see no possible object.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang,\r\n",
        "and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents\r\n",
        "in charge. We went up stairs--into the chamber where the body of\r\n",
        "Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased\r\n",
        "still lay. The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to\r\n",
        "exist. I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the \"Gazette des\r\n",
        "Tribunaux.\" Dupin scrutinized every thing--not excepting the bodies of\r\n",
        "the victims. We then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a\r\n",
        "_gendarme_ accompanying us throughout. The examination occupied us until\r\n",
        "dark, when we took our departure. On our way home my companion stepped\r\n",
        "in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that _Je les\r\n",
        "m\u00e9nageais_:--for this phrase there is no English equivalent. It was his\r\n",
        "humor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder,\r\n",
        "until about noon the next day. He then asked me, suddenly, if I had\r\n",
        "observed any thing _peculiar_ at the scene of the atrocity.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word \"peculiar,\"\r\n",
        "which caused me to shudder, without knowing why.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"No, nothing _peculiar_,\" I said; \"nothing more, at least, than we both\r\n",
        "saw stated in the paper.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"The 'Gazette,'\" he replied, \"has not entered, I fear, into the unusual\r\n",
        "horror of the thing. But dismiss the idle opinions of this print. It\r\n",
        "appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very\r\n",
        "reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution--I mean\r\n",
        "for the _outr\u00e9_ character of its features. The police are confounded by\r\n",
        "the seeming absence of motive--not for the murder itself--but for\r\n",
        "the atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by the seeming\r\n",
        "impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with\r\n",
        "the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated\r\n",
        "Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without\r\n",
        "the notice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room; the\r\n",
        "corpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful\r\n",
        "mutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those\r\n",
        "just mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed\r\n",
        "to paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted\r\n",
        "_acumen_, of the government agents. They have fallen into the gross but\r\n",
        "common error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by\r\n",
        "these deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its\r\n",
        "way, if at all, in its search for the true. In investigations such as we\r\n",
        "are now pursuing, it should not be so much asked 'what has occurred,'\r\n",
        "as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before.' In fact, the\r\n",
        "facility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of\r\n",
        "this mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the\r\n",
        "eyes of the police.\"\r\n",

        "apartment--\"I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not\r\n",
        "the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure\r\n",
        "implicated in their perpetration. Of the worst portion of the crimes\r\n",
        "committed, it is probable that he is innocent. I hope that I am right\r\n",
        "in this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the\r\n",
        "entire riddle. I look for the man here--in this room--every moment. It\r\n",
        "is true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will.\r\n",
        "Should he come, it will be necessary to detain him. Here are pistols;\r\n",
        "and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what\r\n",
        "I heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy. I have\r\n",
        "already spoken of his abstract manner at such times. His discourse was\r\n",
        "addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that\r\n",
        "intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great\r\n",
        "distance. His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"That the voices heard in contention,\" he said, \"by the party upon the\r\n",
        "stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved\r\n",
        "by the evidence. This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether\r\n",
        "the old lady could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have\r\n",
        "committed suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method;\r\n",
        "for the strength of Madame L'Espanaye would have been utterly unequal\r\n",
        "to the task of thrusting her daughter's corpse up the chimney as it\r\n",
        "was found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely\r\n",
        "preclude the idea of self-destruction. Murder, then, has been committed\r\n",
        "by some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard\r\n",
        "in contention. Let me now advert--not to the whole testimony respecting\r\n",
        "these voices--but to what was _peculiar_ in that testimony. Did you\r\n",
        "observe any thing peculiar about it?\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff\r\n",
        "voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard\r\n",
        "to the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"That was the evidence itself,\" said Dupin, \"but it was not the\r\n",
        "peculiarity of the evidence. You have observed nothing distinctive.\r\n",
        "Yet there _was_ something to be observed. The witnesses, as you remark,\r\n",
        "agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous. But in regard to\r\n",
        "the shrill voice, the peculiarity is--not that they disagreed--but\r\n",
        "that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a\r\n",
        "Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that _of\r\n",
        "a foreigner_. Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own\r\n",
        "countrymen. Each likens it--not to the voice of an individual of any\r\n",
        "nation with whose language he is conversant--but the converse.\r\n",
        "The Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and 'might have\r\n",
        "distinguished some words _had he been acquainted with the Spanish._' The\r\n",
        "Dutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it\r\n",
        "stated that '_not understanding French this witness was examined through\r\n",
        "an interpreter._' The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and\r\n",
        "'_does not understand German._' The Spaniard 'is sure' that it was that\r\n",
        "of an Englishman, but 'judges by the intonation' altogether, '_as he has\r\n",
        "no knowledge of the English._' The Italian believes it the voice of a\r\n",
        "Russian, but '_has never conversed with a native of Russia._' A second\r\n",
        "Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the\r\n",
        "voice was that of an Italian; but, _not being cognizant of that tongue_,\r\n",
        "is, like the Spaniard, 'convinced by the intonation.' Now, how strangely\r\n",
        "unusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as\r\n",
        "this _could_ have been elicited!--in whose _tones_, even, denizens of\r\n",
        "the five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar! You\r\n",
        "will say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic--of an African.\r\n",
        "Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the\r\n",
        "inference, I will now merely call your attention to three points.\r\n",
        "The voice is termed by one witness 'harsh rather than shrill.' It\r\n",
        "is represented by two others to have been 'quick and _unequal._' No\r\n",
        "words--no sounds resembling words--were by any witness mentioned as\r\n",
        "distinguishable.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I know not,\" continued Dupin, \"what impression I may have made, so\r\n",
        "far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that\r\n",
        "legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony--the\r\n",
        "portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices--are in themselves\r\n",
        "sufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all\r\n",
        "farther progress in the investigation of the mystery. I said 'legitimate\r\n",
        "deductions;' but my meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed\r\n",
        "to imply that the deductions are the _sole_ proper ones, and that the\r\n",
        "suspicion arises _inevitably_ from them as the single result. What the\r\n",
        "suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to\r\n",
        "bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a\r\n",
        "definite form--a certain tendency--to my inquiries in the chamber.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall\r\n",
        "we first seek here? The means of egress employed by the murderers. It is\r\n",
        "not too much to say that neither of us believe in pr\u00e6ternatural events.\r\n",
        "Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits. The\r\n",
        "doers of the deed were material, and escaped materially. Then how?\r\n",
        "Fortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that\r\n",
        "mode _must_ lead us to a definite decision.--Let us examine, each by\r\n",
        "each, the possible means of egress. It is clear that the assassins were\r\n",
        "in the room where Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was found, or at least in the\r\n",
        "room adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only from\r\n",
        "these two apartments that we have to seek issues. The police have laid\r\n",
        "bare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every\r\n",
        "direction. No _secret_ issues could have escaped their vigilance. But,\r\n",
        "not trusting to _their_ eyes, I examined with my own. There were, then,\r\n",
        "no secret issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage\r\n",
        "were securely locked, with the keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys.\r\n",
        "These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the\r\n",
        "hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large\r\n",
        "cat. The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus\r\n",
        "absolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those of the front room\r\n",
        "no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street.\r\n",
        "The murderers _must_ have passed, then, through those of the back room.\r\n",
        "Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are,\r\n",
        "it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent\r\n",
        "impossibilities. It is only left for us to prove that these apparent\r\n",
        "'impossibilities' are, in reality, not such.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by\r\n",
        "furniture, and is wholly visible. The lower portion of the other is\r\n",
        "hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust\r\n",
        "close up against it. The former was found securely fastened from within.\r\n",
        "It resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. A\r\n",
        "large gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very\r\n",
        "stout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon examining\r\n",
        "the other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and\r\n",
        "a vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also. The police were now\r\n",
        "entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions. And,\r\n",
        "_therefore_, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the\r\n",
        "nails and open the windows.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the\r\n",
        "reason I have just given--because here it was, I knew, that all apparent\r\n",
        "impossibilities _must_ be proved to be not such in reality.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I proceeded to think thus--_a posteriori_. The murderers did escape\r\n",
        "from one of these windows. This being so, they could not have refastened\r\n",
        "the sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened;--the\r\n",
        "consideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny\r\n",
        "of the police in this quarter. Yet the sashes _were_ fastened. They\r\n",
        "_must_, then, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no\r\n",
        "escape from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement,\r\n",
        "withdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash.\r\n",
        "It resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated. A concealed spring\r\n",
        "must, I now know, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced\r\n",
        "me that my premises at least, were correct, however mysterious still\r\n",
        "appeared the circumstances attending the nails. A careful search soon\r\n",
        "brought to light the hidden spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with\r\n",
        "the discovery, forbore to upraise the sash.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing\r\n",
        "out through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would\r\n",
        "have caught--but the nail could not have been replaced. The conclusion\r\n",
        "was plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations. The\r\n",
        "assassins _must_ have escaped through the other window. Supposing, then,\r\n",
        "the springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there _must_\r\n",
        "be found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes\r\n",
        "of their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked\r\n",
        "over the head-board minutely at the second casement. Passing my hand\r\n",
        "down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring,\r\n",
        "which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor.\r\n",
        "I now looked at the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently\r\n",
        "fitted in the same manner--driven in nearly up to the head.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have\r\n",
        "misunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase,\r\n",
        "I had not been once 'at fault.' The scent had never for an instant\r\n",
        "been lost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the\r\n",
        "secret to its ultimate result,--and that result was _the nail._ It\r\n",
        "had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other\r\n",
        "window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive us it might\r\n",
        "seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this\r\n",
        "point, terminated the clew. 'There _must_ be something wrong,' I said,\r\n",
        "'about the nail.' I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an\r\n",
        "inch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in\r\n",
        "the gimlet-hole where it had been broken off. The fracture was an old\r\n",
        "one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been\r\n",
        "accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded,\r\n",
        "in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. I now\r\n",
        "carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had\r\n",
        "taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete--the\r\n",
        "fissure was invisible. Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash\r\n",
        "for a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed.\r\n",
        "I closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again\r\n",
        "perfect.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped through\r\n",
        "the window which looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord upon\r\n",
        "his exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become fastened by the\r\n",
        "spring; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken\r\n",
        "by the police for that of the nail,--farther inquiry being thus\r\n",
        "considered unnecessary.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I had\r\n",
        "been satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five feet\r\n",
        "and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod.\r\n",
        "From this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the\r\n",
        "window itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that\r\n",
        "the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by\r\n",
        "Parisian carpenters _ferrades_--a kind rarely employed at the present\r\n",
        "day, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux.\r\n",
        "They are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door)\r\n",
        "except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis--thus\r\n",
        "affording an excellent hold for the hands. In the present instance these\r\n",
        "shutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from\r\n",
        "the rear of the house, they were both about half open--that is to say,\r\n",
        "they stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the\r\n",
        "police, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if\r\n",
        "so, in looking at these _ferrades_ in the line of their breadth (as they\r\n",
        "must have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or,\r\n",
        "at all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having\r\n",
        "once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this\r\n",
        "quarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination.\r\n",
        "It was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window\r\n",
        "at the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach\r\n",
        "to within two feet of the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by\r\n",
        "exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance\r\n",
        "into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected.--By\r\n",
        "reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the\r\n",
        "shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp\r\n",
        "upon the trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing\r\n",
        "his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he\r\n",
        "might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the\r\n",
        "window open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a _very_\r\n",
        "unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and\r\n",
        "so difficult a feat. It is my design to show you, first, that the thing\r\n",
        "might possibly have been accomplished:--but, secondly and _chiefly_, I\r\n",

        "the ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity\r\n",
        "brutal, a butchery without motive, a _grotesquerie_ in horror absolutely\r\n",
        "alien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men\r\n",

        "madman,\" I said, \"has done this deed--some raving maniac, escaped from a\r\n",
        "neighboring _Maison de Sant\u00e9._\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"In some respects,\" he replied, \"your idea is not irrelevant. But the\r\n",
        "voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to\r\n",
        "tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs. Madmen are of some\r\n",
        "nation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always\r\n",
        "the coherence of syllabification. Besides, the hair of a madman is not\r\n",
        "such as I now hold in my hand. I disentangled this little tuft from the\r\n",
        "rigidly clutched fingers of Madame L'Espanaye. Tell me what you can make\r\n",
        "of it.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon\r\n",
        "this paper. It is a _fac-simile_ drawing of what has been described in\r\n",
        "one portion of the testimony as 'dark bruises, and deep indentations\r\n",
        "of finger nails,' upon the throat of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and in\r\n",
        "another, (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne,) as a 'series of livid spots,\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"You will perceive,\" continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon\r\n",
        "the table before us, \"that this drawing gives the idea of a firm\r\n",
        "and fixed hold. There is no _slipping_ apparent. Each finger has\r\n",
        "retained--possibly until the death of the victim--the fearful grasp by\r\n",
        "which it originally imbedded itself. Attempt, now, to place all your\r\n",
        "fingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see\r\n",
        "them.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "I made the attempt in vain.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,\" he said. \"The\r\n",
        "paper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is\r\n",
        "cylindrical. Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which\r\n",
        "is about that of the throat. Wrap the drawing around it, and try the\r\n",
        "experiment again.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before. \"This,\"\r\n",
        "I said, \"is the mark of no human hand.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Read now,\" replied Dupin, \"this passage from Cuvier.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the\r\n",
        "large fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gigantic\r\n",
        "stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and\r\n",
        "the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known\r\n",
        "to all. I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"The description of the digits,\" said I, as I made an end of reading,\r\n",
        "\"is in exact accordance with this drawing. I see that no animal but an\r\n",
        "Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the\r\n",
        "indentations as you have traced them. This tuft of tawny hair, too, is\r\n",
        "identical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier. But I cannot\r\n",
        "possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery. Besides,\r\n",
        "there were _two_ voices heard in contention, and one of them was\r\n",
        "unquestionably the voice of a Frenchman.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost\r\n",
        "unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice,--the expression, '_mon\r\n",
        "Dieu!_' This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by\r\n",
        "one of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of\r\n",
        "remonstrance or expostulation. Upon these two words, therefore, I have\r\n",
        "mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman\r\n",
        "was cognizant of the murder. It is possible--indeed it is far more\r\n",
        "than probable--that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody\r\n",
        "transactions which took place. The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from\r\n",
        "him. He may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating\r\n",
        "circumstances which ensued, he could never have re-captured it. It is\r\n",
        "still at large. I will not pursue these guesses--for I have no right to\r\n",
        "call them more--since the shades of reflection upon which they are based\r\n",
        "are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect,\r\n",
        "and since I could not pretend to make them intelligible to the\r\n",
        "understanding of another. We will call them guesses then, and speak\r\n",
        "of them as such. If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose,\r\n",
        "innocent of this atrocity, this advertisement which I left last night,\r\n",
        "upon our return home, at the office of 'Le Monde,' (a paper devoted to\r\n",
        "the shipping interest, and much sought by sailors,) will bring him to\r\n",
        "our residence.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "He handed me a paper, and I read thus:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "CAUGHT--_In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the--inst.,_\r\n",
        "(the morning of the murder,) _a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of\r\n",
        "the Bornese species. The owner, (who is ascertained to be a sailor,\r\n",
        "belonging to a Maltese vessel,) may have the animal again, upon\r\n",
        "identifying it satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from\r\n",
        "its capture and keeping. Call at No. ----, Rue ----, Faubourg St.\r\n",

        "\"I do _not_ know it,\" said Dupin. \"I am not _sure_ of it. Here, however,\r\n",
        "is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy\r\n",
        "appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those\r\n",
        "long _queues_ of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot is one\r\n",
        "which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese. I\r\n",
        "picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod. It could not have\r\n",
        "belonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my\r\n",
        "induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to\r\n",
        "a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in\r\n",
        "the advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have\r\n",
        "been misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble\r\n",
        "to inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained. Cognizant\r\n",
        "although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate\r\n",
        "about replying to the advertisement--about demanding the Ourang-Outang.\r\n",
        "He will reason thus:--'I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of\r\n",
        "great value--to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself--why should\r\n",
        "I lose it through idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within my\r\n",
        "grasp. It was found in the Bois de Boulogne--at a vast distance from the\r\n",
        "scene of that butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast\r\n",
        "should have done the deed? The police are at fault--they have failed to\r\n",
        "procure the slightest clew. Should they even trace the animal, it would\r\n",
        "be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me\r\n",
        "in guilt on account of that cognizance. Above all, _I am known._ The\r\n",
        "advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast. I am not sure to\r\n",
        "what limit his knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a property\r\n",
        "of so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the\r\n",
        "animal at least, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to attract\r\n",
        "attention either to myself or to the beast. I will answer the\r\n",
        "advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this\r\n",
        "matter has blown over.'\"\r\n",

        "muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of\r\n",
        "countenance, not altogether unprepossessing. His face, greatly sunburnt,\r\n",
        "was more than half hidden by whisker and _mustachio._ He had with him\r\n",
        "a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed. He bowed\r\n",
        "awkwardly, and bade us \"good evening,\" in French accents, which,\r\n",
        "although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a\r\n",
        "Parisian origin.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "\"Well,\" replied my friend, \"that is all very fair, to be sure. Let me\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "Dupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly. Just as\r\n",
        "quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it and put the key in\r\n",
        "his pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without\r\n",
        "the least flurry, upon the table.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The sailor's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation.\r\n",

        "injury. I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities\r\n",
        "in the Rue Morgue. It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some\r\n",
        "measure implicated in them. From what I have already said, you must know\r\n",
        "that I have had means of information about this matter--means of which\r\n",
        "you could never have dreamed. Now the thing stands thus. You have done\r\n",
        "nothing which you could have avoided--nothing, certainly, which renders\r\n",

        "the latter had nearly come up with it. It then again made off. In this\r\n",
        "manner the chase continued for a long time. The streets were profoundly\r\n",
        "quiet, as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning. In passing down\r\n",

        "arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L'Espanaye's\r\n",
        "chamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it\r\n",
        "perceived the lightning rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility,\r\n",
        "grasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and,\r\n",
        "by its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed. The\r\n",

        "from the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it\r\n",
        "might be intercepted as it came down. On the other hand, there was\r\n",
        "much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter\r\n",
        "reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning rod\r\n",

        "arrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was\r\n",
        "stopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to\r\n",
        "obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly\r\n",
        "fell from his hold through excess of horror. Now it was that those\r\n",
        "hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber\r\n",
        "the inmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter,\r\n",
        "habited in their night clothes, had apparently been occupied in\r\n",
        "arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had\r\n",
        "been wheeled into the middle of the room. It was open, and its contents\r\n",
        "lay beside it on the floor. The victims must have been sitting with\r\n",
        "their backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the\r\n",
        "ingress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not\r\n",
        "immediately perceived. The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally\r\n",
        "have been attributed to the wind.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame\r\n",
        "L'Espanaye by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing\r\n",
        "it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the\r\n",
        "motions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had\r\n",
        "swooned. The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the\r\n",
        "hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably\r\n",
        "pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. With one\r\n",
        "determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her\r\n",
        "body. The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy. Gnashing its\r\n",
        "teeth, and flashing fire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the\r\n",
        "girl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp\r\n",
        "until she expired. Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment\r\n",
        "upon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with\r\n",
        "horror, was just discernible. The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore\r\n",
        "still in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear.\r\n",
        "Conscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of\r\n",
        "concealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony\r\n",
        "of nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it\r\n",
        "moved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. In conclusion, it seized\r\n",
        "first the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as\r\n",
        "it was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled\r\n",
        "through the window headlong.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor\r\n",
        "shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it,\r\n",
        "hurried at once home--dreading the consequences of the butchery, and\r\n",
        "gladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the\r\n",
        "Ourang-Outang. The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the\r\n",

        "had passed, and passed without any light being thrown upon the subject,\r\n",
        "before even a rumor of the events which had so agitated the public\r\n",
        "mind, reached the ears of Dupin and myself. Engaged in researches which\r\n",
        "absorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a month since either of\r\n",
        "us had gone abroad, or received a visiter, or more than glanced at\r\n",
        "the leading political articles in one of the daily papers. The first\r\n",
        "intelligence of the murder was brought us by G ----, in person. He\r\n",
        "called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth of July, 18--,\r\n",
        "and remained with us until late in the night. He had been piqued by\r\n",
        "the failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the assassins. His\r\n",
        "reputation--so he said with a peculiarly Parisian air--was at stake.\r\n",
        "Even his honor was concerned. The eyes of the public were upon him; and\r\n",
        "there was really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for\r\n",
        "the development of the mystery. He concluded a somewhat droll speech\r\n",
        "with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of Dupin,\r\n",
        "and made him a direct, and certainly a liberal proposition, the precise\r\n",
        "nature of which I do not feel myself at liberty to disclose, but which\r\n",
        "has no bearing upon the proper subject of my narrative.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the proposition\r\n",
        "he accepted at once, although its advantages were altogether\r\n",
        "provisional. This point being settled, the Prefect broke forth at\r\n",
        "once into explanations of his own views, interspersing them with\r\n",
        "long comments upon the evidence; of which latter we were not yet in\r\n",
        "possession. He discoursed much, and beyond doubt, learnedly; while\r\n",
        "I hazarded an occasional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away.\r\n",
        "Dupin, sitting steadily in his accustomed arm-chair, was the embodiment\r\n",
        "of respectful attention. He wore spectacles, during the whole interview;\r\n",
        "and an occasional signal glance beneath their green glasses, sufficed\r\n",
        "to convince me that he slept not the less soundly, because silently,\r\n",
        "throughout the seven or eight leaden-footed hours which immediately\r\n",
        "preceded the departure of the Prefect.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In the morning, I procured, at the Prefecture, a full report of all\r\n",
        "the evidence elicited, and, at the various newspaper offices, a copy\r\n",
        "of every paper in which, from first to last, had been published any\r\n",
        "decisive information in regard to this sad affair. Freed from all that\r\n",
        "was positively disproved, this mass of information stood thus:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Marie Rog\u00eat left the residence of her mother, in the Rue Pav\u00e9e\r\n",
        "St. Andr\u00e9e, about nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday June the\r\n",
        "twenty-second, 18--. In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur Jacques\r\n",
        "St. Eustache, (*7) and to him only, of her intent intention to spend the\r\n",
        "day with an aunt who resided in the Rue des Dr\u00f4mes. The Rue des Dr\u00f4mes\r\n",
        "is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare, not far from the banks\r\n",
        "of the river, and at a distance of some two miles, in the most direct\r\n",
        "course possible, from the pension of Madame Rog\u00eat. St. Eustache was the\r\n",
        "accepted suitor of Marie, and lodged, as well as took his meals, at\r\n",
        "the pension. He was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk, and to\r\n",
        "have escorted her home. In the afternoon, however, it came on to rain\r\n",
        "heavily; and, supposing that she would remain all night at her aunt's,\r\n",
        "(as she had done under similar circumstances before,) he did not think\r\n",
        "it necessary to keep his promise. As night drew on, Madame Rog\u00eat (who\r\n",
        "was an infirm old lady, seventy years of age,) was heard to express\r\n",
        "a fear \"that she should never see Marie again;\" but this observation\r\n",
        "attracted little attention at the time.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "On Monday, it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the Rue des\r\n",
        "Dr\u00f4mes; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her, a tardy search\r\n",
        "was instituted at several points in the city, and its environs. It was\r\n",
        "not, however until the fourth day from the period of disappearance that\r\n",
        "any thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting her. On this day,\r\n",
        "(Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of June,) a Monsieur Beauvais, (*8) who,\r\n",
        "with a friend, had been making inquiries for Marie near the Barri\u00e8re\r\n",
        "du Roule, on the shore of the Seine which is opposite the Rue Pav\u00e9e St.\r\n",
        "Andr\u00e9e, was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore by some\r\n",
        "fishermen, who had found it floating in the river. Upon seeing the\r\n",
        "body, Beauvais, after some hesitation, identified it as that of the\r\n",
        "perfumery-girl. His friend recognized it more promptly.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued from the\r\n",
        "mouth. No foam was seen, as in the case of the merely drowned. There was\r\n",
        "no discoloration in the cellular tissue. About the throat were bruises\r\n",
        "and impressions of fingers. The arms were bent over on the chest and\r\n",
        "were rigid. The right hand was clenched; the left partially open. On\r\n",
        "the left wrist were two circular excoriations, apparently the effect\r\n",
        "of ropes, or of a rope in more than one volution. A part of the right\r\n",
        "wrist, also, was much chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent,\r\n",
        "but more especially at the shoulder-blades. In bringing the body to\r\n",
        "the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope; but none of the\r\n",
        "excoriations had been effected by this. The flesh of the neck was much\r\n",
        "swollen. There were no cuts apparent, or bruises which appeared the\r\n",
        "effect of blows. A piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the\r\n",
        "neck as to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried in the flesh,\r\n",
        "and was fasted by a knot which lay just under the left ear. This alone\r\n",
        "would have sufficed to produce death. The medical testimony spoke\r\n",
        "confidently of the virtuous character of the deceased. She had been\r\n",
        "subjected, it said, to brutal violence. The corpse was in such condition\r\n",
        "when found, that there could have been no difficulty in its recognition\r\n",
        "by friends.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The dress was much torn and otherwise disordered. In the outer garment,\r\n",
        "a slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom hem to\r\n",
        "the waist, but not torn off. It was wound three times around the waist,\r\n",
        "and secured by a sort of hitch in the back. The dress immediately\r\n",
        "beneath the frock was of fine muslin; and from this a slip eighteen\r\n",
        "inches wide had been torn entirely out--torn very evenly and with great\r\n",
        "care. It was found around her neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a\r\n",
        "hard knot. Over this muslin slip and the slip of lace, the strings of a\r\n",
        "bonnet were attached; the bonnet being appended. The knot by which the\r\n",
        "strings of the bonnet were fastened, was not a lady's, but a slip or\r\n",
        "sailor's knot.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, taken to the\r\n",
        "Morgue, (this formality being superfluous,) but hastily interred not far\r\n",
        "from the spot at which it was brought ashore. Through the exertions of\r\n",
        "Beauvais, the matter was industriously hushed up, as far as possible;\r\n",
        "and several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted. A\r\n",
        "weekly paper, (*9) however, at length took up the theme; the corpse was\r\n",
        "disinterred, and a re-examination instituted; but nothing was elicited\r\n",
        "beyond what has been already noted. The clothes, however, were\r\n",
        "now submitted to the mother and friends of the deceased, and fully\r\n",
        "identified as those worn by the girl upon leaving home.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Meantime, the excitement increased hourly. Several individuals were\r\n",
        "arrested and discharged. St. Eustache fell especially under suspicion;\r\n",
        "and he failed, at first, to give an intelligible account of his\r\n",
        "whereabouts during the Sunday on which Marie left home. Subsequently,\r\n",
        "however, he submitted to Monsieur G----, affidavits, accounting\r\n",
        "satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question. As time passed and\r\n",
        "no discovery ensued, a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated,\r\n",
        "and journalists busied themselves in suggestions. Among these, the one\r\n",
        "which attracted the most notice, was the idea that Marie Rog\u00eat still\r\n",
        "lived--that the corpse found in the Seine was that of some other\r\n",
        "unfortunate. It will be proper that I submit to the reader some passages\r\n",
        "which embody the suggestion alluded to. These passages are literal\r\n",
        "translations from L'Etoile, (*10) a paper conducted, in general, with\r\n",
        "much ability.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Mademoiselle Rog\u00eat left her mother's house on Sunday morning, June the\r\n",
        "twenty-second, 18--, with the ostensible purpose of going to see her\r\n",
        "aunt, or some other connexion, in the Rue des Dr\u00f4mes. From that hour,\r\n",
        "nobody is proved to have seen her. There is no trace or tidings of her\r\n",
        "at all.... There has no person, whatever, come forward, so far, who\r\n",
        "saw her at all, on that day, after she left her mother's door.... Now,\r\n",
        "though we have no evidence that Marie Rog\u00eat was in the land of the\r\n",
        "living after nine o'clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have\r\n",
        "proof that, up to that hour, she was alive. On Wednesday noon, at\r\n",
        "twelve, a female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barri\u00e8re\r\n",
        "de Roule. This was, even if we presume that Marie Rog\u00eat was thrown into\r\n",
        "the river within three hours after she left her mother's house, only\r\n",
        "three days from the time she left her home--three days to an hour. But\r\n",
        "it is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on\r\n",
        "her body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her\r\n",
        "murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight. Those who\r\n",
        "are guilty of such horrid crimes, choose darkness rather the light....\r\n",
        "Thus we see that if the body found in the river was that of Marie Rog\u00eat,\r\n",
        "it could only have been in the water two and a half days, or three at\r\n",
        "the outside. All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies\r\n",
        "thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from\r\n",
        "six to ten days for decomposition to take place to bring them to the top\r\n",
        "of the water. Even where a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises\r\n",
        "before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again, if let\r\n",
        "alone. Now, we ask, what was there in this cave to cause a departure\r\n",
        "from the ordinary course of nature?... If the body had been kept in its\r\n",
        "mangled state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on\r\n",
        "shore of the murderers. It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body\r\n",
        "would be so soon afloat, even were it thrown in after having been\r\n",
        "dead two days. And, furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable that any\r\n",
        "villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would\r\n",
        "have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution\r\n",
        "could have so easily been taken.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in the\r\n",
        "water \"not three days merely, but, at least, five times three days,\"\r\n",
        "because it was so far decomposed that Beauvais had great difficulty\r\n",
        "in recognizing it. This latter point, however, was fully disproved. I\r\n",
        "continue the translation:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that he has no\r\n",
        "doubt the body was that of Marie Rog\u00eat? He ripped up the gown sleeve,\r\n",
        "and says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity. The public\r\n",
        "generally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description\r\n",
        "of scars. He rubbed the arm and found hair upon it--something as\r\n",
        "indefinite, we think, as can readily be imagined--as little conclusive\r\n",
        "as finding an arm in the sleeve. M. Beauvais did not return that night,\r\n",
        "but sent word to Madame Rog\u00eat, at seven o'clock, on Wednesday evening,\r\n",
        "that an investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter. If\r\n",
        "we allow that Madame Rog\u00eat, from her age and grief, could not go over,\r\n",
        "(which is allowing a great deal,) there certainly must have been some\r\n",
        "one who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the\r\n",
        "investigation, if they thought the body was that of Marie. Nobody went\r\n",
        "over. There was nothing said or heard about the matter in the Rue Pav\u00e9e\r\n",
        "St. Andr\u00e9e, that reached even the occupants of the same building. M. St.\r\n",
        "Eustache, the lover and intended husband of Marie, who boarded in her\r\n",
        "mother's house, deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the\r\n",
        "body of his intended until the next morning, when M. Beauvais came\r\n",
        "into his chamber and told him of it. For an item of news like this, it\r\n",
        "strikes us it was very coolly received.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "In this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy\r\n",
        "on the part of the relatives of Marie, inconsistent with the supposition\r\n",
        "that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers. Its insinuations\r\n",
        "amount to this:--that Marie, with the connivance of her friends, had\r\n",
        "absented herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against\r\n",
        "her chastity; and that these friends, upon the discovery of a corpse in\r\n",
        "the Seine, somewhat resembling that of the girl, had availed themselves\r\n",
        "of the opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her\r\n",
        "death. But L'Etoile was again over-hasty. It was distinctly proved\r\n",
        "that no apathy, such as was imagined, existed; that the old lady was\r\n",
        "exceedingly feeble, and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any\r\n",
        "duty, that St. Eustache, so far from receiving the news coolly, was\r\n",
        "distracted with grief, and bore himself so frantically, that M. Beauvais\r\n",
        "prevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of him, and prevent\r\n",
        "his attending the examination at the disinterment. Moreover, although\r\n",
        "it was stated by L'Etoile, that the corpse was re-interred at the public\r\n",
        "expense--that an advantageous offer of private sculpture was absolutely\r\n",
        "declined by the family--and that no member of the family attended the\r\n",
        "ceremonial:--although, I say, all this was asserted by L'Etoile in\r\n",
        "furtherance of the impression it designed to convey--yet all this\r\n",
        "was satisfactorily disproved. In a subsequent number of the paper, an\r\n",
        "attempt was made to throw suspicion upon Beauvais himself. The editor\r\n",
        "says:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"Now, then, a change comes over the matter. We are told that on one\r\n",
        "occasion, while a Madame B---- was at Madame Rog\u00eat's house, M. Beauvais,\r\n",
        "who was going out, told her that a gendarme was expected there, and she,\r\n",
        "Madame B., must not say anything to the gendarme until he returned,\r\n",
        "but let the matter be for him.... In the present posture of affairs,\r\n",
        "M. Beauvais appears to have the whole matter locked up in his head. A\r\n",
        "single step cannot be taken without M. Beauvais; for, go which way you\r\n",
        "will, you run against him.... For some reason, he determined that nobody\r\n",
        "shall have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself, and he\r\n",
        "has elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their\r\n",
        "representations, in a very singular manner. He seems to have been very\r\n",
        "much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown\r\n",
        "upon Beauvais. A visiter at his office, a few days prior to the girl's\r\n",
        "disappearance, and during the absence of its occupant, had observed a\r\n",
        "rose in the key-hole of the door, and the name \"Marie\" inscribed upon a\r\n",
        "slate which hung near at hand.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The general impression, so far as we were enabled to glean it from the\r\n",
        "newspapers, seemed to be, that Marie had been the victim of a gang\r\n",
        "of desperadoes--that by these she had been borne across the river,\r\n",
        "maltreated and murdered. Le Commerciel, (*11) however, a print of\r\n",
        "extensive influence, was earnest in combating this popular idea. I quote\r\n",
        "a passage or two from its columns:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent, so\r\n",
        "far as it has been directed to the Barri\u00e8re du Roule. It is impossible\r\n",
        "that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should\r\n",
        "have passed three blocks without some one having seen her; and any one\r\n",
        "who saw her would have remembered it, for she interested all who knew\r\n",
        "her. It was when the streets were full of people, when she went out....\r\n",
        "It is impossible that she could have gone to the Barri\u00e8re du Roule, or\r\n",
        "to the Rue des Dr\u00f4mes, without being recognized by a dozen persons; yet\r\n",
        "no one has come forward who saw her outside of her mother's door, and\r\n",
        "there is no evidence, except the testimony concerning her expressed\r\n",
        "intentions, that she did go out at all. Her gown was torn, bound round\r\n",
        "her, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a bundle. If the\r\n",
        "murder had been committed at the Barri\u00e8re du Roule, there would have\r\n",
        "been no necessity for any such arrangement. The fact that the body was\r\n",
        "found floating near the Barri\u00e8re, is no proof as to where it was thrown\r\n",
        "into the water..... A piece of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats,\r\n",
        "two feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin\r\n",
        "around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done\r\n",
        "by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief.\"\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some important\r\n",
        "information reached the police, which seemed to overthrow, at least,\r\n",
        "the chief portion of Le Commerciel's argument. Two small boys, sons of a\r\n",
        "Madame Deluc, while roaming among the woods near the Barri\u00e8re du Roule,\r\n",
        "chanced to penetrate a close thicket, within which were three or four\r\n",
        "large stones, forming a kind of seat, with a back and footstool. On\r\n",
        "the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf. A\r\n",
        "parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found. The\r\n",
        "handkerchief bore the name \"Marie Rog\u00eat.\" Fragments of dress were\r\n",
        "discovered on the brambles around. The earth was trampled, the bushes\r\n",
        "were broken, and there was every evidence of a struggle. Between the\r\n",
        "thicket and the river, the fences were found taken down, and the ground\r\n",
        "bore evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "A weekly paper, Le Soleil,(*12) had the following comments upon this\r\n",

        "to bring them to the surface. Both science and experience show that the\r\n",
        "period of their rising is, and necessarily must be, indeterminate. If,\r\n",
        "moreover, a body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon,\r\n",
        "it will not 'sink again if let alone,' until decomposition has so far\r\n",
        "progressed as to permit the escape of the generated gas. But I wish to\r\n",
        "call your attention to the distinction which is made between 'drowned\r\n",
        "bodies,' and 'bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by\r\n",
        "violence.' Although the writer admits the distinction, he yet includes\r\n",
        "them all in the same category. I have shown how it is that the body of\r\n",
        "a drowning man becomes specifically heavier than its bulk of water,\r\n",
        "and that he would not sink at all, except for the struggles by which\r\n",
        "he elevates his arms above the surface, and his gasps for breath while\r\n",
        "beneath the surface--gasps which supply by water the place of the\r\n",
        "original air in the lungs. But these struggles and these gasps would\r\n",
        "not occur in the body 'thrown into the water immediately after death by\r\n",
        "violence.' Thus, in the latter instance, the body, as a general rule,\r\n",
        "would not sink at all--a fact of which L'Etoile is evidently ignorant.\r\n",
        "When decomposition had proceeded to a very great extent--when the flesh\r\n",
        "had in a great measure left the bones--then, indeed, but not till then,\r\n",
        "should we lose sight of the corpse.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"And now what are we to make of the argument, that the body found could\r\n",
        "not be that of Marie Rog\u00eat, because, three days only having elapsed,\r\n",
        "this body was found floating? If drowned, being a woman, she might never\r\n",
        "have sunk; or having sunk, might have reappeared in twenty-four hours,\r\n",
        "or less. But no one supposes her to have been drowned; and, dying before\r\n",

        "period afterwards whatever.\r\n",
        "\r\n",

        "murderers.' Here it is at first difficult to perceive the intention\r\n",
        "of the reasoner. He means to anticipate what he imagines would be an\r\n",
        "objection to his theory--viz: that the body was kept on shore two days,\r\n",
        "suffering rapid decomposition--more rapid than if immersed in water. He\r\n",
        "supposes that, had this been the case, it might have appeared at the\r\n",
        "surface on the Wednesday, and thinks that only under such circumstances\r\n",
        "it could so have appeared. He is accordingly in haste to show that it\r\n",
        "was not kept on shore; for, if so, 'some trace would be found on shore\r\n",
        "of the murderers.' I presume you smile at the sequitur. You cannot\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "\"That, in spirit, they are far more worthy of attention than any which\r\n",
        "have been promulgated upon the subject. The deductions from the premises\r\n",
        "are philosophical and acute; but the premises, in two instances, at\r\n",
        "least, are founded in imperfect observation. Le Commerciel wishes to\r\n",
        "intimate that Marie was seized by some gang of low ruffians not far from\r\n",
        "her mother's door. 'It is impossible,' it urges, 'that a person so well\r\n",

        "blocks without some one having seen her.' This is the idea of a man long\r\n",
        "resident in Paris--a public man--and one whose walks to and fro in the\r\n",
        "city, have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices.\r\n",
        "He is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his own\r\n",
        "bureau, without being recognized and accosted. And, knowing the extent\r\n",
        "of his personal acquaintance with others, and of others with him, he\r\n",
        "compares his notoriety with that of the perfumery-girl, finds no great\r\n",
        "difference between them, and reaches at once the conclusion that she, in\r\n",
        "her walks, would be equally liable to recognition with himself in\r\n",
        "his. This could only be the case were her walks of the same unvarying,\r\n",
        "methodical character, and within the same species of limited region\r\n",
        "as are his own. He passes to and fro, at regular intervals, within a\r\n",
        "confined periphery, abounding in individuals who are led to observation\r\n",
        "of his person through interest in the kindred nature of his occupation\r\n",
        "with their own. But the walks of Marie may, in general, be supposed\r\n",
        "discursive. In this particular instance, it will be understood as most\r\n",
        "probable, that she proceeded upon a route of more than average diversity\r\n",
        "from her accustomed ones. The parallel which we imagine to have existed\r\n",
        "in the mind of Le Commerciel would only be sustained in the event of the\r\n",
        "two individuals' traversing the whole city. In this case, granting the\r\n",
        "personal acquaintances to be equal, the chances would be also equal that\r\n",
        "an equal number of personal rencounters would be made. For my own\r\n",
        "part, I should hold it not only as possible, but as very far more than\r\n",

        "one of the many routes between her own residence and that of her aunt,\r\n",
        "without meeting a single individual whom she knew, or by whom she was\r\n",
        "known. In viewing this question in its full and proper light, we must\r\n",
        "hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the personal\r\n",

        "The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all _mildewed_\r\n",

        "could only have been ascertained from the words, and thus from the\r\n",
        "recollections, of two small boys; for these boys removed the articles\r\n",
        "and took them home before they had been seen by a third party. But grass\r\n",

        "be made by a not over-acute person wishing to dispose the articles\r\n",
        "naturally. But it is by no means a really natural arrangement. I\r\n",
        "should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and\r\n",
        "trampled under foot. In the narrow limits of that bower, it would have\r\n",
        "been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained\r\n",
        "a position upon the stones, when subjected to the brushing to and fro\r\n",
        "of many struggling persons. 'There was evidence,' it is said, 'of a\r\n",
        "struggle; and the earth was trampled, the bushes were broken,'--but the\r\n",

        "rents, at right angles with each other, and meeting at an apex where the\r\n",
        "thorn enters--but it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece 'torn\r\n",
        "off.' I never so knew it, nor did you. To tear a piece off from such\r\n",
        "fabric, two distinct forces, in different directions, will be, in almost\r\n",

        "a slip, then, and then only, will the one force serve the purpose. But\r\n",

        "motionless before him. The fury of his passion is over, and there is\r\n",
        "abundant room in his heart for the natural awe of the deed. His is none\r\n",
        "of that confidence which the presence of numbers inevitably inspires.\r\n",
        "He is alone with the dead. He trembles and is bewildered. Yet there is\r\n",
        "a necessity for disposing of the corpse. He bears it to the river, but\r\n",
        "leaves behind him the other evidences of guilt; for it is difficult, if\r\n",
        "not impossible to carry all the burthen at once, and it will be easy to\r\n",
        "return for what is left. But in his toilsome journey to the water his\r\n",
        "fears redouble within him. The sounds of life encompass his path. A\r\n",
        "dozen times he hears or fancies the step of an observer. Even the very\r\n",
        "lights from the city bewilder him. Yet, in time and by long and frequent\r\n",
        "pauses of deep agony, he reaches the river's brink, and disposes of\r\n",
        "his ghastly charge--perhaps through the medium of a boat. But now what\r\n",
        "treasure does the world hold--what threat of vengeance could it hold\r\n",

        "\"And here we must refer to an observation of Le Commerciel; an\r\n",
        "observation upon which I have already, in some measure, commented. 'A\r\n",
        "piece,' says this journal, 'of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats\r\n",
        "was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her\r\n",

        "advert. That it was not through want of a handkerchief for the purpose\r\n",
        "imagined by Le Commerciel, that this bandage was employed, is rendered\r\n",
        "apparent by the handkerchief left in the thicket; and that the object\r\n",
        "was not 'to prevent screams' appears, also, from the bandage having been\r\n",
        "employed in preference to what would so much better have answered\r\n",
        "the purpose. But the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in\r\n",
        "question as 'found around the neck, fitting loosely, and secured with\r\n",
        "a hard knot.' These words are sufficiently vague, but differ materially\r\n",
        "from those of Le Commerciel. The slip was eighteen inches wide, and\r\n",
        "therefore, although of muslin, would form a strong band when folded or\r\n",
        "rumpled longitudinally. And thus rumpled it was discovered. My inference\r\n",
        "is this. The solitary murderer, having borne the corpse, for some\r\n",
        "distance, (whether from the thicket or elsewhere) by means of the\r\n",
        "bandage hitched around its middle, found the weight, in this mode\r\n",
        "of procedure, too much for his strength. He resolved to drag the\r\n",
        "burthen--the evidence goes to show that it was dragged. With this object\r\n",
        "in view, it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one of\r\n",
        "the extremities. It could be best attached about the neck, where the\r\n",
        "head would prevent its slipping off. And, now, the murderer bethought\r\n",
        "him, unquestionably, of the bandage about the loins. He would have used\r\n",
        "this, but for its volution about the corpse, the hitch which embarrassed\r\n",
        "it, and the reflection that it had not been 'torn off' from the garment.\r\n",

        "it fast about the neck, and so dragged his victim to the brink of the\r\n",
        "river. That this 'bandage,' only attainable with trouble and delay, and\r\n",
        "but imperfectly answering its purpose--that this bandage was employed\r\n",

        "inflation was not only exceedingly expensive, but uncertain. Two, and\r\n",
        "even three days, have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to\r\n",
        "procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon, from which it\r\n",
        "had great tendency to escape, owing to its extreme subtlety, and its\r\n",
        "affinity for the surrounding atmosphere. In a balloon sufficiently\r\n",
        "perfect to retain its contents of coal-gas unaltered, in quantity or\r\n",

        "\"The supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds, and the united\r\n",
        "weights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there was left a\r\n",
        "surplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast, arranged\r\n",
        "in bags of different sizes, with their respective weights marked upon\r\n",
        "them--by cordage, barometers, telescopes, barrels containing provision\r\n",
        "for a fortnight, water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other\r\n",
        "indispensable matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming\r\n",
        "coffee by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire,\r\n",
        "if it should be judged prudent to do so. All these articles, with the\r\n",
        "exception of the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended from the\r\n",
        "hoop overhead. The car is much smaller and lighter, in proportion, than\r\n",
        "the one appended to the model. It is formed of a light wicker, and is\r\n",
        "wonderfully strong, for so frail looking a machine. Its rim is about\r\n",
        "four feet deep. The rudder is also very much larger, in proportion, than\r\n",
        "that of the model; and the screw is considerably smaller. The balloon is\r\n",
        "furnished besides with a grapnel, and a guide-rope; which latter is of\r\n",
        "the most indispensable importance. A few words, in explanation, will\r\n",
        "here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the\r\n",
        "details of aerostation.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"As soon as the balloon quits the earth, it is subjected to the\r\n",
        "influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its\r\n",
        "weight; augmenting or diminishing its ascending power. For example,\r\n",
        "there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk, to the extent, even,\r\n",
        "of several hundred pounds; ballast has then to be thrown out, or the\r\n",
        "machine may descend. This ballast being discarded, and a clear sunshine\r\n",
        "evaporating the dew, and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk,\r\n",
        "the whole will again rapidly ascend. To check this ascent, the only\r\n",
        "recourse is, (or rather _was_, until Mr. Green's invention of the\r\n",
        "guide-rope,) the permission of the escape of gas from the valve; but, in\r\n",
        "the loss of gas, is a proportionate general loss of ascending power; so\r\n",
        "that, in a comparatively brief period, the best-constructed balloon must\r\n",
        "necessarily exhaust all its resources, and come to the earth. This was\r\n",
        "the great obstacle to voyages of length.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"The guide-rope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner\r\n",
        "conceivable. It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail\r\n",
        "from the car, and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from\r\n",
        "changing its level in any material degree. If, for example, there should\r\n",
        "be a deposition of moisture upon the silk, and the machine begins to\r\n",
        "descend in consequence, there will be no necessity for discharging\r\n",
        "ballast to remedy the increase of weight, for it is remedied, or\r\n",
        "counteracted, in an exactly just proportion, by the deposit on the\r\n",
        "ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary. If,\r\n",
        "on the other hand, any circumstances should cause undue levity, and\r\n",
        "consequent ascent, this levity is immediately counteracted by the\r\n",
        "additional weight of rope upraised from the earth. Thus, the balloon\r\n",
        "can neither ascend or descend, except within very narrow limits, and its\r\n",
        "resources, either in gas or ballast, remain comparatively unimpaired.\r\n",
        "When passing over an expanse of water, it becomes necessary to employ\r\n",
        "small kegs of copper or wood, filled with liquid ballast of a lighter\r\n",
        "nature than water. These float, and serve all the purposes of a mere\r\n",
        "rope on land. Another most important office of the guide-rope, is to\r\n",
        "point out the _direction_ of the balloon. The rope _drags_, either on\r\n",
        "land or sea, while the balloon is free; the latter, consequently, is\r\n",
        "always in advance, when any progress whatever is made: a comparison,\r\n",
        "therefore, by means of the compass, of the relative positions of the two\r\n",
        "objects, will always indicate the _course_. In the same way, the angle\r\n",
        "formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine, indicates\r\n",
        "the _velocity_. When there is _no_ angle--in other words, when the rope\r\n",
        "hangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is stationary; but the larger\r\n",
        "the angle, that is to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of\r\n",
        "the rope, the greater the velocity; and the converse.\r\n",

        "eleven o'clock. Cut loose, then, in high spirits, and rose gently but\r\n",
        "steadily, with a light breeze at North, which bore us in the direction\r\n",
        "of the British Channel. Found the ascending force greater than we had\r\n",
        "expected; and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs, and\r\n",
        "more in the sun's rays, our ascent became very rapid. I did not wish,\r\n",

        "rapidly. The balloon was unusually steady, and looked beautifully. In\r\n",
        "about ten minutes after starting, the barometer indicated an altitude\r\n",
        "of 15,000 feet. The weather was remarkably fine, and the view of the\r\n",
        "subjacent country--a most romantic one when seen from any point,--was\r\n",
        "now especially sublime. The numerous deep gorges presented the\r\n",

        "the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction, and\r\n",
        "our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind; when\r\n",
        "we set in motion the spring of the screw, and were rejoiced to find it\r\n",
        "propel us readily as desired. Upon this we gave nine hearty cheers, and\r\n",
        "dropped in the sea a bottle, enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief\r\n",
        "account of the principle of the invention. Hardly, however, had we\r\n",
        "done with our rejoicings, when an unforeseen accident occurred which\r\n",

        "before we had secured the rod, and had time to think what we were about.\r\n",
        "It was now that Mr. Ainsworth made an extraordinary, but to my fancy,\r\n",
        "a by no means unreasonable or chimerical proposition, in which he was\r\n",
        "instantly seconded by Mr. Holland--viz.: that we should take advantage\r\n",
        "of the strong gale which bore us on, and in place of beating back to\r\n",
        "Paris, make an attempt to reach the coast of North America. After slight\r\n",
        "reflection I gave a willing assent to this bold proposition, which\r\n",
        "(strange to say) met with objection from the two seamen only. As the\r\n",
        "stronger party, however, we overruled their fears, and kept resolutely\r\n",
        "upon our course. We steered due West; but as the trailing of the buoys\r\n",
        "materially impeded our progress, and we had the balloon abundantly at\r\n",
        "command, either for ascent or descent, we first threw out fifty pounds\r\n",
        "of ballast, and then wound up (by means of a windlass) so much of the\r\n",
        "rope as brought it quite clear of the sea. We perceived the effect of\r\n",
        "this manoeuvre immediately, in a vastly increased rate of progress; and,\r\n",
        "as the gale freshened, we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable; the\r\n",
        "guide-rope flying out behind the car, like a streamer from a vessel. It\r\n",
        "is needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of\r\n",
        "the coast. We passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds, a few of\r\n",
        "which were endeavoring to beat up, but the most of them lying to. We\r\n",
        "occasioned the greatest excitement on board all--an excitement greatly\r\n",
        "relished by ourselves, and especially by our two men, who, now under the\r\n",
        "influence of a dram of Geneva, seemed resolved to give all scruple, or\r\n",
        "fear, to the wind. Many of the vessels fired signal guns; and in all\r\n",
        "we were saluted with loud cheers (which we heard with surprising\r\n",
        "distinctness) and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs. We kept on in\r\n",
        "this manner throughout the day, with no material incident, and, as\r\n",
        "the shades of night closed around us, we made a rough estimate of the\r\n",
        "distance traversed. It could not have been less than five hundred\r\n",
        "miles, and was probably much more. The propeller was kept in constant\r\n",
        "operation, and, no doubt, aided our progress materially. As the sun\r\n",
        "went down, the gale freshened into an absolute hurricane, and the ocean\r\n",
        "beneath was clearly visible on account of its phosphorescence. The wind\r\n",
        "was from the East all night, and gave us the brightest omen of success.\r\n",
        "We suffered no little from cold, and the dampness of the atmosphere was\r\n",
        "most unpleasant; but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down,\r\n",

        "\r\n",
        "THE chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance,\r\n",
        "rather than permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a\r\n",
        "night in the open air, was one of those piles of commingled gloom and\r\n",
        "grandeur which have so long frowned among the Appennines, not less in\r\n",
        "fact than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. To all appearance it had been\r\n",
        "temporarily and very lately abandoned. We established ourselves in one\r\n",
        "of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments. It lay in a\r\n",
        "remote turret of the building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered\r\n",
        "and antique. Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with\r\n",
        "manifold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unusually\r\n",
        "great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden\r\n",
        "arabesque. In these paintings, which depended from the walls not only\r\n",
        "in their main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre\r\n",
        "architecture of the chateau rendered necessary--in these paintings my\r\n",
        "incipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so\r\n",
        "that I bade Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room--since it was\r\n",
        "already night--to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by\r\n",
        "the head of my bed--and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains\r\n",
        "of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done\r\n",
        "that I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the\r\n",
        "contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which\r\n",
        "had been found upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and\r\n",
        "describe them.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Long--long I read--and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and\r\n",
        "gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came. The position of\r\n",
        "the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty,\r\n",
        "rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its\r\n",
        "rays more fully upon the book.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. The rays of\r\n",
        "the numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of\r\n",
        "the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the\r\n",
        "bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It\r\n",
        "was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood. I glanced\r\n",
        "at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did this\r\n",
        "was not at first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids\r\n",
        "remained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting\r\n",
        "them. It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought--to make\r\n",
        "sure that my vision had not deceived me--to calm and subdue my fancy for\r\n",
        "a more sober and more certain gaze. In a very few moments I again looked\r\n",
        "fixedly at the painting.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first\r\n",
        "flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the\r\n",
        "dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at\r\n",
        "once into waking life.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl. It was a\r\n",
        "mere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a vignette\r\n",
        "manner; much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the\r\n",
        "bosom, and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into\r\n",
        "the vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole. The\r\n",
        "frame was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque. As a thing of\r\n",
        "art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. But it\r\n",
        "could have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal\r\n",
        "beauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved\r\n",
        "me. Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half\r\n",
        "slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person. I saw at\r\n",
        "once that the peculiarities of the design, of the vignetting, and of the\r\n",
        "frame, must have instantly dispelled such idea--must have prevented even\r\n",
        "its momentary entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these points, I\r\n",
        "remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my\r\n",
        "vision riveted upon the portrait. At length, satisfied with the true\r\n",
        "secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed. I had found the spell\r\n",
        "of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at\r\n",
        "first startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me. With deep\r\n",
        "and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position. The\r\n",
        "cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly\r\n",
        "the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories. Turning\r\n",
        "to the number which designated the oval portrait, I there read the vague\r\n",
        "and quaint words which follow:\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "\"She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of\r\n",
        "glee. And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the\r\n",
        "painter. He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride\r\n",
        "in his Art; she a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full\r\n",
        "of glee; all light and smiles, and frolicsome as the young fawn; loving\r\n",
        "and cherishing all things; hating only the Art which was her rival;\r\n",
        "dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments\r\n",
        "which deprived her of the countenance of her lover. It was thus a\r\n",
        "terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to\r\n",
        "portray even his young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat\r\n",
        "meekly for many weeks in the dark, high turret-chamber where the light\r\n",
        "dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead. But he, the painter,\r\n",
        "took glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour, and from day to\r\n",
        "day. And he was a passionate, and wild, and moody man, who became lost\r\n",
        "in reveries; so that he would not see that the light which fell so\r\n",
        "ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his\r\n",
        "bride, who pined visibly to all but him. Yet she smiled on and still on,\r\n",
        "uncomplainingly, because she saw that the painter (who had high renown)\r\n",
        "took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and\r\n",
        "night to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more dispirited\r\n",
        "and weak. And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its\r\n",
        "resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of\r\n",
        "the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted\r\n",
        "so surpassingly well. But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its\r\n",
        "conclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the painter\r\n",
        "had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes from\r\n",
        "canvas merely, even to regard the countenance of his wife. And he would\r\n",
        "not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from\r\n",
        "the cheeks of her who sate beside him. And when many weeks had passed,\r\n",
        "and but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one\r\n",
        "tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the\r\n",
        "flame within the socket of the lamp. And then the brush was given,\r\n",
        "and then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the painter stood\r\n",
        "entranced before the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while\r\n",
        "he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying\r\n",
